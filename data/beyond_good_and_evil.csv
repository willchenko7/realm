"References for all quota- tions from BGE are to section numbers"
"Introduction  aphorisms, and he ends the book with a poem that hints at the artistic background to his concern with decadence and the means for overcoming it"
"Thus it would seem that the whole range of Nietzsche’s interests, his prejudices and his preferences, his loathings and his hopes, and above all his deep insights into our situation in the modern world, are united in an exemplary way in BGE , and for this reason it is a great book"
"Although there is something to be said for this view, it is not the only view that is possible"
"There are quite a number of thinkers who would in- sist that it makes no sense at all to attribute greatness to any of Nietzsche’s works"
"According to pro- ponents of this view, the best way to think of Nietzsche’s works is as the disturbing documents of the creative process of someone who was on the verge of madness"
"To call any of his works great would therefore amount to a categorical mistake"
"Interestingly enough, this bleak evaluation is not based on any disagreement with what the work’s admirers tell us we will find in it, or even any disagreement with the claim that it gives us the quintessential Nietzsche"
"It is a perplexing fact that it is by no means easy to decide which of these two conflicting attitudes towards BGE should prevail, and in the end it may be a rather personal matter"
"Nevertheless it is possible to identify some conditions that will influence how we are likely to think about the merits of this work"
"Three main factors should be taken into consideration"
"First, much depends on how we interpret the aims pursued by Nietzsche’s work in general and BGE in particular"
"Second, our evaluation will depend on the amount of tolerance and sympathy that we are prepared to mobilize towards Nietzsche the person, and also towards certain tendencies in bourgeois culture in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century"
"If we are not convinced of the soundness of our normal views, then we might have second thoughts about things, and in   Introduction  that case a book like BGE might be considered illuminating and even helpful"
"II  Let us start with Nietzsche the person"
"Moreover, in some cases authors intentionally withdraw from their products in an attempt to become invisible and to let the work speak for itself, and thus leave us very few personal clues in their works"
"Rousseau could serve as an example of the first kind of case and Kant of the second; Kant goes so far as to use the phrase de nobis ipsis silemus ('of our own person we will say nothing') as a motto for his main work"
"We therefore tend to believe that a distinction can be drawn between the private views of the author and the meaning of the work which the author produces"
"Yet there are some works with respect to which such a consideration does not so easily apply"
"These are works whose very meaning is tied intrinsically to the person of their author, as is the case with diaries, letters, personal notes, or autobiographies"
"Here our knowledge about the author, or perhaps an understanding of the situation the author is in, are necessary ingredients for an appreciation of the text"
"There are many reasons to presume that Nietzsche thought of many of his texts as being like diaries or personal notes that tell us something about himself and about his perspective on the matters they address, rather than as products that aim at objective, non-personal results"
"Hence, his biography may be of interest in any attempt to assess his work"
"Nietzsche’s life is surely not a success story; on the contrary, it is a rather sad story of misery and failure"
"It is the story of a man who from the beginning of his adult life, until the sudden and catastrophic end of his productive period, was confronted with embarrassing and humiliating experiences"
"This is true of his private life as well as of his relations with the intellectual community of his time"
"He was plagued by ill health, a psychosomatic wreck, suffering from all sorts of diseases ranging from chronic nervous ailments and severe eye problems, which left him almost  IX   Introduction  blind, to extremely exhausting states of prolonged migraine"
"These con- ditions made life tolerable for him only in a few places in northern Italy (in the winter) and the Swiss Engadine (in the summer), and it is in these places that he spent most of his time in the 1880s"
"His social relations were always, to put it mildly, somewhat complicated"
"Those who appar- ently cared most about him, his mother and his sister, he found oppressive and distasteful because they represented a type of personality he deeply despised"
"2 Though he prided himself on being comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been very successful in establishing emotionally satisfying relationships with them, which is hardly surprising given his views on women and on femininity (Weiblichkeit) in general"
"3 Things did not go much better with his friends"
"The people whom he called 'friends' he quite often spoke of with great resentment: he charged all of them with a lack of sensitivity toward him, he complained that none of them ever bothered to study his works, and he accused them of failing to defend him against public neglect"
"4 In short, he suffered deeply from a sense of soli- tude and isolation, from not being appropriately acknowledged because of the supposed imperfections of the people around him"
"To make things even worse, Nietzsche was not given the opportunity to compensate for the shortcomings of his private life by enjoying insti- tutional and public success in his roles as a university teacher and author"
"Although he made a very promising start - he was appointed professor of classics at Basle university at the early age of twenty-four - his academic career disintegrated rapidly, in part because of his poor health and in part because he became annoyed with his teaching duties"
"As for his fortunes as an author, not much can be said that is positive"

"3 Though Nietzsche addresses this topic in BGE as well (§ 232 et seq"
"), the general tendency of his outlook on women is documented most succinctly in the relevant passage of Ecce Homo ('Why I write such good books,' § 5)"

"Introduction  part emphatically negative) and of members of the Wagnerian community (including Wagner himself )"
"This lack of interest showed in the dismal number of copies sold of his books"
"6  The most discouraging experience for Nietzsche, however, may not have been this failure to gain a wider recognition"
"If he could have believed that his few readers represented some sort of elite, perhaps a group of distinguished intellectuals, then their taking notice of his writings would have been of importance to him and this might have counterbalanced his lack of public success"
"Unfortunately he could not entertain even that belief"
"From the very few reactions he became aware of - mostly reviews of his books in more or less obscure journals - he had to conclude that he was read by only a few readers - and the wrong ones"
"In his view, his readership consisted of people either unable or unwilling (or both) to understand him adequately"
"He blamed his readers for not being in the least prepared to give credit to his intentions and for being attentive only to those points which conveniently confirmed them in their own negative preconceptions"
"What he was missing on a fundamental level was a readiness on the part of readers to explore things his way, a feeling of intellectual kinship between author and audience, or, to put it another way, he deeply craved recognition from an audience that he thought fitting"
"This is touchingly expressed in two short remarks from Ecce Homo"
"The first relates explicitly only to his Zarathustra, though it is quite likely that Nietzsche thought it true of his other writings as well: 'In order to  5 See the Introduction by Raymond Geuss to the edition of The Birth of Tragedy in this series (Cambridge University Press, 1999)"
"6 Of the book Nietzsche valued most, Zarathustra, whose first three parts were published separately in 1883 and 1884, only about sixty to seventy copies each were sold within the first three years after their appearance (see letter to Franz Overbeck, summer 1886: KSB VII, pp"
"The fourth part of the Zarathustra was published in 1885 in a private edition of only forty copies and was not accessible to a wider public before 1892"
"BGE did not fare much better: 1 14 copies were sold within a year (see letter to Peter Gast, 8 June 1887: KSB VIII, pp"
"Nietzsche comments (in the same letter to Gast): 'Instructive! Namely, they simply don’t want my literature"
"' It seems that most of his other books had the same fate — they too were utterly neglected during the period in his life when he would still have cared about their success"
"XI   Introduction  understand anything at all from my Zarathustra, you might need to be conditioned as I am - with one foot beyond life"
"' 7 The second remark delineates what he takes to be his ideal reader, and there is no doubt that he meant what he says: 'When I call up the image of a perfect reader, what emerges is a monster of courage and curiosity, who is also supple, clever, cautious, a born adventurer and discoverer"
"' 8  What emerges is a picture of a totally isolated, highly neurotic man who had to try hard to avoid thinking of himself as a complete failure"
"It is this ability which, in my view, accounts for two dominant traits that appear in his published works"
"The first is that he never even came close to considering the possibility that - given the general intellectual climate of his time - his lack of success as an author might have something to do with his pursuing the 'wrong' topics in a 'wrong' way"
"It never crossed his mind that what he thought to be an interesting, novel, and valuable insight might indeed have been exactly what it seemed to be to almost all of his contemporaries - an overstated triviality, an extremely one-sided exaggeration or an embarrassing piece of bad reasoning"
"He simply stuck to the points he felt he had to make, deeply convinced of being on the right track, and fending off all signs of criticism or neglect with the maxim 'so much the worse for the critic"
"' 9  7 Ecce Homo ('Why I am so wise,' end of § 3)"
"('Why I write such good books,' end of § 3)"
"In the same text he mentions explicitly the reactions to BGE as an example of how severely it was misunderstood or, to use his terminology, how gravely this book was sinned against because its readers were not up to its challenge ('Why I write such good books,' end of § 1)"
"9 In Ecce Homo Nietzsche even presents an explanation as to why he believes this stance to be perfectly reasonable: 'Ultimately, nobody can get more out of things, including books, than he already knows"
"For what one lacks access to from experience one will have no ear"
"Now let us imagine an extreme case: that a book speaks of nothing but events that lie altogether beyond the possibility of any frequent or even rare experience — that it is the first language for a new series of experiences"
"In that case, simply nothing will be heard, but there will be the acoustic illusion that where nothing is heard, nothing is there"
"Whoever thought he had understood something of me, had made up something out of me after his own image"
"and whoever had understood nothing of me, denied that I need to be considered at all"
"' 'Why I write such good books,' § 1,  xii   Introduction  This attitude becomes increasingly visible in his writings after Zarathustra and culminates in his late texts of 1888, especially in Ecce Homo"
"Here we find brilliant and witty remarks which rightly became notorious (though Nietzsche himself might not have found them very amusing, because they can also be read as documents of despair)"
"I quote two of them: 'We all know, several of us even know from experience, what it is to have long ears"
"Well then, I will dare to claim that I have the smallest ears"
"This is of no little interest to women - it seems they think I understand them better?"
"I am the anti-ass par excellence and this makes me a world-historical monster — I am, in Greek, but not only in Greek, the Antichrist"
"' 10 The other is: 'I know my fate"
"One day, my name will be associated with the memory of something tremendous - a crisis the like of which the world has never seen, the most profound col- lision of conscience, of a decision brought about against everything that has ever been believed, demanded, or held holy so far"
"I am not a man"
"I am dynamite"
"' 11  The second trait which we find in Nietzsche’s writings is closely con- nected to his inability to assess himself in the light of others’ reactions"
"It consists in his total unconcern about the tenability of his views when judged according to standards that he thinks are alien to his approach"
"Starting from the conviction that there is no common ground between him and his reader, that what he has to say is most likely incomprehensi- ble to almost everybody else, he does not feel obliged to enter the social game of competitive discourse"
"He refuses to try to convince people by somehow connecting to their way of thinking; he does not refute possi- ble arguments against the points he wants to make by giving reasons in their favor"
"Instead, he makes abundantly clear his contempt for 'nor- mal' thinking and his impatience with the evaluations of others"
"It is this stance which gives so many readers the impression of an overwhelming polemical element in Nietzsche’s literary presentation of his views"
"He reinforces it by insisting over and over again that what he has to tell us are above all his truths"
"The claim to exclusivity is meant to imply both that his main concern is not whether we find these truths convincing, and  translation from W"

"This does not mean that the stories he has to tell us about, say, truth, morality, the will to power, or culture are, in his view, on a par with fictions, pleasant or otherwise"
"On the contrary, he believed his stories to be the ultimate stories, the stories that are destined to become the standard versions of our assessment of these phenomena"
"Before looking more closely at some aspects of BGE itself, let me sum- marize what I take to be the lessons for approaching Nietzsche’s writings that can be learned from his personal situation and his way of dealing with it"
"He does not want to be 'one of us' - instead he insists on what he calls 'distance,' in order to uphold his view of himself and to remind us of his uniqueness"
"A last quotation from Ecce Homo may highlight these points: ' Listen to me [the emphasis is on the ‘me’]"
"For I am thus and thus"
"Do not, above all, confound me"

"XIV   Introduction  III  BGE is the first book Nietzsche published after Thus Spoke Zarathustra"
"He never gave up on the notion that all he really wanted to say is contained in Zarathustra , and this led him to claim that the works he wrote after Zarathustra are essentially nothing but elaborations and explications of ideas already present in his opus magnum"
"13 However that may be, Nietzsche himself was of the opinion that Zarathustra set the stage for everything he had to do subsequently"
"He writes: 'The task for the years that followed [i"
"the years after Zarathustra\ was mapped out as clearly as possible"
"Once the yes-saying part of my task had been solved [by means of Zarathustra ], it was time for the no-saying, no-doing part"
"' 14 This seems to imply that he regarded his post -Zarathustra writings as consisting of predominantly critical essays"
"BGE is best known to a wider public for its proverbs"
"Indeed, some of Nietzsche’s best-known maxims are assembled in this text, ranging from perspicuous insights to highly controversial statements"
"These proverbs are in a way the least of what BGE has to offer"
"Its primary fascination lies on a deeper level: this book introduces us into a world of remarkable conjectures, suspicions, and implications"
"Though one might say this is true of most of Nietzsche’s other published works as well, with the exception of Zara thustra , there is nevertheless a difference  13 See, e"

"XV   Introduction  in emphasis between BGE and the other writings"
"In BGE Nietzsche confronts us primarily (though not exclusively) with a dimension of his thought that he was particularly proud of - his psychological stance"
"Nietzsche himself gives the following account of what he is doing in BGE: 'This book (1886) is in every essential a critique of modernity, mod- ern sciences, modern arts, even modern politics are not excluded"
"Besides this, it is an indication of an opposing type, which is as un-modern as pos- sible, a noble, yes-saying type"
"' 15 Though this characterization is accurate and confirms the view that Nietzsche considers his task to be mainly a critical one, it is by no means complete"
"Interestingly enough, it does not mention two topics which some readers take to be the subject of the most disturbing reflections in the book: morality and religion"
"This is surpris- ing because these are the topics which seem to emerge most strongly in any consideration of its main message"
"In order to appreciate the distinctive approach which Nietzsche favors in BGE in his dealings with what he calls 'modernity,' it might be worth- while to say a few words about his more general outlook"
"His first conviction was that life is best conceived of as a chaotic dynamic process without any stability or direction"
"The second is articulated in the claim that we have no reason whatsoever to believe in any such thing as the 'sense' or the 'value' of life, insofar as these terms imply the idea  ■5 Ibid"
"XVI   Introduction  of an 'objective' or 'natural' purpose of life"
"The third is that human life is value-oriented in its very essence - that is, without adherence to some set of values or other, human life would be virtually impossible"
"Whereas the first conviction is supposed to state an ontological fact, the second is meant to be an application of the ontological point to the nor- mative aspects of human life in particular"
"The third conviction, though somewhat at odds with the other two, is taken by Nietzsche to reveal a psychological necessity"
"(How Nietzsche came to hold these convictions, and whether they can be supported, there is not space to examine here, although a closer look would no doubt lead back to his use of some of Schopenhauer’s ideas and to his picture of what constituted the cultural life of pre-Socratic ancient Greece"
")  Against the background of these convictions, Nietzsche became inter- ested in the question of the origin of values, a question that eventually led him to a whole array of unorthodox and original answers"
"Though presumably we are all endowed with this capacity , 16 there are very few of us who manage to create values powerful enough to force people into acceptance and to constitute cultural and social profiles"
", of science, philosophy, and theology"
"Thus, anyone interested in the function and the origin of values should scrutinize the processes which enabled these persons and institutions to create values"
"At this point Nietzsche’s more detailed investigations tend to start spreading out in a remarkable number of different directions"
"It is here, too, that in one sense we should take BGE to have its point of depar- ture"
"That the detailed analysis of all the phenomena connected with the  16 For, after all, there seems to be no reason to think that Nietzsche would not allow in principle that each of us could be transformed into a 'free spirit,' i"
", a person who has the capacity and strength to create and stick to the 'right' values"
"xvii   Introduction  concept of value is a very tricky task methodologically is documented not only in BGE but also in almost all of Nietzsche’s other writings"
"Acknowledging the fact that the different features of the value-creating processes are much too complex to be accessible by means of a single explanatory scheme, Nietzsche tentatively pursues several different ap- proaches"
"He merges psychological hypotheses with causal explanations, and combines them with historical observations and linguistic consid- erations into a multi-perspectival technique that he fondly refers to as his 'genealogical method"
"At the risk of oversimplification one can say the bulk of this work addresses three topics, each one of which can be expressed best in terms of a question"
"This is something we should never forget when we confront his texts"
"Nietzsche speaks to us from the past, and this fact alone might account for some features of his writing that we would now consider idiosyncratic - for example, his way of talking about women and about national characteristics"
"IV  At this point we face a problem that I take to be crucial for any adequate assessment of Nietzsche’s project"
"It concerns the manner in which we are to comprehend his approach to the topics under examination"
"However, in the case of Nietzsche and BGE it is by no means evident that such a procedure would capture what Nietzsche is doing and what BGE is all about"
"There are few arguments to be found in BGE, and those which can be extracted are seldom of the most convincing kind"
"Following the normal procedure would also encourage the illusion that Nietzsche designed BGE to be understood simply in terms of arguments, whether good or bad, and I cannot find anything in BGE which would encourage such an illusion"
"17  There is considerable evidence that we should try a different approach, and the clue lies in Nietzsche’s numerous allusions to the practices of what he calls the 'new philosophers"
"Rather, one would expect such a person to pursue a very different path in expressing his views, which would involve starting with a bold claim or striking observation and then using it in a variety of different ways"
"It might form the basis for an analysis of something in terms of that claim or observation, or it might point to a symptom, presupposition, or consequence of a very general or a very particular state of affairs"
"It even might be related tentatively to topics which at first sight have nothing  17 There are passages that make it very hard to believe in this illusion"
", remarks in § 5 that the activity of reason-giving is a post hoc affair intended to justify 'some fervent wish that they have sifted through and made properly abstract,' or (in the same section) his making fun of Spinoza’s mos geometricus as a masquerade"
"In my eyes, the most striking passage for discouraging this illusion is to be found in § 213, where Nietzsche talks about what he calls philosophical states or moods"
"Here he compares the 'right' way of doing philosophy with the 'normal' attitude and writes concerning the latter: 'You [‘normal’ philosophers] imagine every necessity is a need, a painful having to follow and being compelled"
"' This 'having to follow' and 'being compelled' I read as a reference to the procedure of establishing results via sound arguments"
"18 Nietzsche uses the German word Versuch (attempt, experiment) in a broad way which makes that term cover the connotations of Versuchung (temptation) and Versucher (tempter) as well"
"XIX   Introduction  to do with what the original claim or the first observation was about"
"In short, one could envision a philosopher under the spell of Nietzschean 'new philosophy' as someone whose methodology is deeply entangled in and in thrall to what could be called 'what if' scenarios"
"19  If this is how a 'new philosopher' approaches problems, it seems beside the point to treat Nietzsche’s proclaimed insights as based on arguments"
"The concept of a 'result' or a 'solution' also becomes obsolete, since this type of philosophy is obviously not oriented towards results and solutions understood in the sense of statements which can be defended against thorough critical resistance"
"Its aim consists instead in the uncovering of surprising possibilities and the playful presentation of innovative per- spectives that do not aspire to the status of rock-hard 'truths' but are meant to be offerings or propositions for a like-minded spirit"
"20  Nietzsche obviously intended BGE to exemplify as clearly as possible all the characteristics he attributes to the style, the method, and the intentions of the 'new philosophers' - and yet it is remarkable how often this fact is not sufficiently acknowledged by his interpreters"
"' This doctrine  19 It should go without saying that this imagined scenario does not exclude 'good arguments"
"' Rather, the scenario is meant to show that if one deals with topics in the way outlined above, the guiding intention is not to give or to find 'good arguments"
"' In Nietzsche’s terminology, this amounts to the claim that a 'good argument' is not an overriding methodological 'value"
"' Invoking his polemical inventory, one could say, in his spirit: to be obsessed by 'the will to a good argument' indicates bad taste"
"20 Again, this characterization is not meant to suggest that what these 'new philosophers' are proclaiming is something they are not serious about or do not want us to take seriously"
"It is only meant to emphasize that what they put forward is connected very intimately with their personal point of view, and hence it is nothing that they can force on someone if there is no shared basis of experience, of resentment ( ressentiment ), or suffering"
"See BGE § 43, where Nietzsche expresses this point in an especially belligerent fashion"
"21 These attempts do not necessarily result in uninformative or misleading accounts of aspects of Nietzsche’s thought"
"On the contrary, many of them shed considerable light on the historical background of his ideas and on the impact they could have on various discussions that happen to take place within the framework of academic philosophy"
"They are, however, operating under the unavoidable (and, perhaps, reasonable) restrictions of that framework"
"This puts them in the position of having to abstract from the personal or 'perspectival' features essential to Nietzsche’s conceptions"
"That there is a price to be paid for this 'academization' is obvious"
"It is revealed in the difference between the excitement and fun that one can have in reading Nietzsche and the boredom that one sometimes experiences when reading the literature on him"
"XX   Introduction  in its most trivial reading amounts to the claim that our view of the world and, consequently, the statements we take to be true, depend on our situation, on our 'perspective' on the world"
"Though it is true that in some of his more conventional moods Nietzsche seems to have thought about perspectivism along these lines, this reading gives no hint whatsoever of why he should have been attracted to such a doctrine in his more inspired moments"
"In this epistemological version the doctrine is neither original nor interesting, but merely a version of skeptical or idealist claims that used to be connected in popular writings with names like Berkeley and Kant"
"By looking at this doctrine in this context, we can appreciate it as stating conditions for understanding an expression that purports to express something true, be it a text, a statement, or a con- fession"
"(2) In order  22 Here I have to confess that this sketch of the epistemological interpretation of Nietzsche’s per- spectivism may not be the most sympathetic one, and no doubt one can find in the literature much more sophisticated versions of this doctrine"
"However, this does not affect the main point I want to make, which consists in the claim that the epistemological reading misses the central feature of Nietzsche’s doctrine"
"There are some other misgivings concerning the reading that deserve mention"
"The first consists in the fact that Nietzsche — especially in BGE — is not in sympathy with skepticism (see § 208)"
"' It should be noted that the 'German form of skepticism' discussed approvingly in § 209 has nothing to do with epistemological skepticism"
"XXI   Introduction  to judge the correctness, or perhaps merely the plausibility, of such a claim, one has to have an experiential or existential background similar to that of the person who made the claim"
"It is because of this insis- tence on integrating subjective aspects into the process of understanding, and because of the idea that judging the truth of a view presupposes shared experiences, that I call this the 'socio-hermeneutical' reading of perspectivism"
"If perspectivism is understood in these terms, then much of what is going on in BGE and other texts by Nietzsche begins to look considerably less arbitrary and idiosyncratic than has been claimed"
"For example, his so-called 'theory of truth' which he alludes to quite often in the first two books of BGE, seems less absurd than many commentators have taken it to be"
"These three statements together seem to imply the paradoxical claim that it is true that there is no truth"
"So the critic argues"
"23 However, when read in the light of the preceding remarks a much less extravagant interpretation of Niet- zsche’s theory of truth suggests itself which is completely independent of the issue of whether he really subscribes to these three statements"
"On this interpretation, Nietzsche’s theory claims only (1) that there are no context-free truths, where a context is to be defined as the set of subjective conditions that the utterer of a truth is governed by and that anyone who wishes correctly to judge it is able to apprehend"
"From this it follows (3) that, given our situation, every truth is defined by this necessarily  23 That there are many epistemological and logical problems connected with holding such a para- doxical claim is not difficult to point out"
"The most comprehensive discussion of these problems with reference to Nietzsche that I know of is by M"
"Clark, Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 1990)"
"24 Put a bit more bluntly, this claim amounts to the assertion that the concept 'objective or absolute truth' is an empty concept when understood in contraposition to 'perspectival truth"
"'  xxii   Introduction  incomplete context"
"Thus every truth is a partial truth or a perspectival fiction"
"25  This 'socio-hermeneutical' reading of perspectivism points to a more commonsensical understanding of Nietzsche’s claims regarding truth"
"It also suggests that some of the stylistic peculiarities of BGE and other texts had a methodological function"
"BGE, like most of Nietzsche’s other texts, has an aphoristic form"
"26 It looks like a collection of impromptu remarks, each of which explores to a different degree of depth some aspect or other of a particular observation, specific claim, or surprising phenomenon"
"These remarks are numbered and loosely organized into topic-related groups, each one of which carries a short descriptive phrase that functions as its title"
"The impression is of an apparently arbitrary compilation of notes which are actually presented in an artful, though idiosyncratic way"
"Thus it has been maintained that we should approach BGE as we would a work of literature rather than strictly in terms of philosophical text"
"Though this impression is by no means misleading, it fails to be sensitive to the intentions guiding the architectonic of this text"
"If a claim is fully com- prehensible only when placed in its appropriate subjective and existential context, then it is incumbent on an author to convey as much information about this context as possible"
"One way of doing this consists in presenting a whole array of thoughts which are designed primarily to inform us about the various subjective stances characteristic of the individual making the claim"
"The resulting collection may seem random because it can include almost any conceivable digression under the pretense of being informative about the subjective context"
"However, if the socio-hermeneutical inter- pretation is correct, the seeming randomness of Nietzsche’s aphorisms can equally well be taken as a calculated and methodologically appropri- ate consequence of his perspectivism"
"In Nietzsche’s writings, as in life, randomness can turn out to be an applied method in disguise"
"25 It should be noticed that this reading is compatible with some of the most disturbing features of Nietzsche’s talk about truth"
"It allows us to make sense of his insistence that there are degrees of truth, which is exhibited most clearly in BGE in his reflection on how much 'truth' one can take (§ 39)"
"It also makes understandable the idea, very important to him, that truth is just a special case of error"
"And it allows for the use of personal pronouns in connection with truth, a habit Nietzsche is very fond of (cf"
"§§ 5, 43, 231)"
"26 Though there is some question as to the applicability of terms such as 'aphorism' or 'aphoristic form' to Nietzsche’s texts, he himself does not seem to have problems with such a characterization"
"His own use of these terms in reference to his writings is documented in On the Genealogy of Morals , Preface § 2 ( KSA V, p"
"248) and § 8 ( KSA V, p"
"255) and in Twilight of Idols, §§ 9, 51 (KSA VI, p"
"xxiii   Introduction  V  BGE deals with questions of how values arise psychologically and how we should evaluate them"
"It also treats such political and social values as democracy, equality, and progress, seeing them as means of oppression and as indicators of decay and degeneration"
"Most of this is done with the aim of finding out what brought about the modern way of life, and what made modern culture such a doomed en- terprise"
"Neither this critical message nor the material Nietzsche relies upon in order to substantiate his assessment of modernity is peculiar to BGE"
"In almost all his other writings , 27 he discusses the shortcomings of philoso- phy, the dangers of religion, the built-in biases of science, and the dam- aging consequences of institutionalized moral and cultural values, and he arrives at similar bleak conclusions"
"Thus, the message of BGE is just an- other version of Nietzsche’s general project"
"However, BGE is distinctive not only in its emphasis on a psychological explanation of the rise to domi- nance of specific values, but also in two further respects"
"The first relates to the doctrine of the 'will to power,' the second to his views on what might be called 'good' or 'adequate' ways of confronting reality"
"Both topics be- long to his relatively rare excursions into the world of 'positive' thinking"
"27 Obviously this overlap is intended by Nietzsche"
"It seems to be an architectonic device, for he frequently quotes from and alludes to his other texts"
"The best example of this practice is to be found right at the beginning (§ 2) of BGE where he cites almost verbatim from the beginning of Human, All Too Human"
"This quotation refers to his diagnosis of the most fundamental mistake of traditional metaphysicians, i"
", their conception of the origin of oppositions"
"Glatzeder: ‘ Perspektiven der Wiinschbarkeit ’"
"Nietzsches Metaphysikkritik in Menschliches Allzumenschliches (Philo Verlag: Berlin, 2000)"
"In quoting this appraisal, which forms the basis of his far reaching criticism of metaphysics and its notion of 'objective' truth, he can treat it like a result whose justification is already given elsewhere"
"XXIV   Introduction  The 'will to power' makes its first public appearance in Thus Spoke Zarathustra"
"There it is introduced as one of the three major teachings Zarathustra has to offer, the other two being his advocacy of the over- man ( Ubermensch ) and the conception of the Eternal Recurrence"
"It is somewhat surprising that in Zarathustra Nietzsche has little to say about what the 'will to power' means"
"Fortunately he is a bit more explicit in BGE , although here too the doctrine receives what is by no means an exhaustive treatment"
"28 There is, however, some evidence that he wants us to think of this doctrine as advancing or at least implying an ontological hypothesis"
"This suggests that what governs these processes is some sort of power struggle where every single form of life has a tendency to overpower every other form"
"However, to think of life in this way we have to assume that each living particle is endowed with a certain amount of power that it has a will to realize"
"This amount is supposed to define its 'will to power' and thus is ultimately decisive for its ability to develop itself and to survive, or, to use a famous Nietzschean phrase, for its potential to become what it is"
"It is this line of thought which led Nietzsche to the assertion that life is 'will to power' (§§ 13, 259)"
"But this is merely one part of the story"
"In BGE Nietzsche tentatively tries to pursue the conception of a 'will to power' in a further direction"
"He aims at a broader application of the conception by transforming it from a principle of organic life into a much broader axiom pertaining to the essence of nature in general"
"It is here that it acquires an ontological meaning"
"However, though the Nachlass indeed contains a considerable amount of material pertaining to that conception, it has the disadvantage of giving support to widely divergent, if not contradictory, interpretations"
"This is due to the fact that Nietzsche seems to have been experimenting with different meanings of this concept without reaching a definite position"
"To appreciate the whole range of readings possible see, for example, G"
"Abel, Nietzsche: Die Dynamik der Willen zur Macht und die ewige Wiederkehr (de Gruyter: Berlin, 1998, 2nd edn), and V"
"Gerhardt, Vom Willen zur Macht: Anthropologie und Metaphysik der Macht am exemplarischen Fall Friedrich Nietzsches (de Gruyter: Berlin, 1996)"
"XXV   Introduction  reason to restrict the explanatory force of that concept to organic life"
"Why not think of inorganic matter, of the material world, in terms of 'will to power' as well? Matter would then have to be conceived as 'will to power' paralyzed, as 'will to power' in a state of potentiality"
"According to Nietzsche this view would allow for a unified account of the world in its totality: 'The world seen from inside, the world determined and described with respect to its ‘intelligible character’ - would be just this will to power and nothing else' (§ 36)"
"It goes without saying that Nietzsche is very much in favor of this claim"
"Even if it is conceded that Nietzsche never really elaborated his concept of the 'will to power' sufficiently, it does not appear to be one of his more attractive ideas"
"The reason for this is that it purports to give us insight into the essence of nature, what nature is 'in itself,' but this does not square well with his emphatic criticism, put forward in BGE and elsewhere, of the very notion of an 'in itself"
"' According to Nietzsche there is no 'in itself,' no essence, no fixed nature of things, and all beliefs to the contrary are founded on deep and far-reaching metaphysical illusions"
"It seems therefore that one cannot avoid the unsettling conclusion that the doctrine of a 'will to power' shares all the vices which Nietzsche attributes to metaphysical thinking in general"
"There are no such untoward consequences of the second piece of 'posi- tive' thinking in BGE, but this is because it scarcely qualifies as thinking at all, consisting instead of fantasies about what the ideal conditions would be for a person to be able to participate in productive thinking"
"Here produc- tive thinking seems to mean the capacity to live up to the task of enduring an unbiased assessment of reality"
"Nietzsche summarizes these fantasies in the picture he gives of the 'new philosophers' and in remarks on what it means to be noble"
"Nobility, for him, has to do with putting oneself at a distance from people and things"
"It is rooted in and is the product of the 'pathos of distance,' to use his influential formula (§ 257)"
"This pathos has to be conceived as the socially inherited ability (1) to have a sense for differences in rank between persons, (2) to accept these differences as pointing to differences in distinction (defined as a positive quality of worthiness), and (3) to strive for higher distinction"
"A person possessing  xxvi   Introduction  this ability is able to strive for unique states of awareness: 'Without the pa thos of distance"
"The ability to achieve such states seems to function as a condition of gaining important insights and having the psychological resources needed to live with them, and it indicates a cer- tain stance towards reality superior to 'normal' or 'common' attitudes (cf"
"With this plea for nobility Nietzsche states again his conviction that what ultimately counts in our epistemic dealings with reality is not knowl- edge per se, that is, knowledge detached from the knower"
"What deserves the title of knowledge has to be intimately connected with the special and unique situation a knowing subject is in"
"This is so not only because according to Nietzsche knowledge is not an 'objective' or impersonal affair, something one can have like a detached thing that one possesses, but above all because the knowing subject has to live his knowledge"
"The extent to which a subject can do this depends on personal constitution, character traits, and intellectual robustness"
"Knowledge thus becomes as- sociated with the question of how much truth one can endure (cf"
"' This at least seems to be Nietzsche’s message"
"What is it that makes reading BGE and other writings of Nietzsche such an attractive and stimulating experience? The main reason, I believe, has little to do with the plausibility, let alone the correctness, of his views"
"On the contrary, we like many of his ideas precisely because of their pointed one-sidedness, their extravagance, and their eccentricity"
"Nor, I suspect, are we now especially preoccupied with the topics which he obviously took to be decisive for an evaluation of our way of living under modern conditions"
"Many of his themes we now consider rather obsolete, and to some of them we no longer have any immediate access because they  xxvii   Introduction  are deeply rooted in their nineteenth-century contexts"
"The fascination his works still have must therefore originate from somewhere else"
"This would suggest that Nietzsche’s works may still be captivating because they confront a concern that is not restricted to modern times"
"They address our uncomfortable feeling that our awareness of ourselves and of the world depends on conceptions that we ultimately do not understand"
"We conceive of ourselves as subjects trying to live a decent life, guided in our doings by aims that ht the normal expectations of our social and cultural environment; we believe certain things to be true beyond any doubt, and we hold others and ourselves to many moral obligations"
"Although all this is constitutive of a normal way of life, we have only a vague idea of why we have to deal with things in this way; we do not really know what in the end justifies these practices"
"In questioning not the normality but the objectivity or truth of such a normal world view, Nietzsche’s writings can have the effect of making us feel less worried about our inability to account for some of our central convictions in an 'absolute' way"
"It is up to each of us to decide whether to be grateful for this reminder or to loathe it"

"Their contribution to the project is gratefully acknowledged"
"If it is even left standing! Because there are those who make fun of dogmatism, claiming that it has fallen over, that it is lying flat on its face, or more, that dogmatism is in its last gasps"
"But seriously, there are good reasons for hoping that all dogmatizing in philos- ophy was just noble (though childish) ambling and preambling, however solemn, settled and decisive it might have seemed"
"Let us hope that the dogmatists’ philosophy was only a promise over the millennia, as was the case even earlier with astrology, in whose service perhaps more la- bor, money, ingenuity, and patience was expended than for any real science so far"
"We owe the great style of architecture in Asia and Egypt to astrol- ogy and its 'supernatural' claims"
"We should not be ungrateful towards dogmatism, but it must nonetheless be said that the worst, most prolonged, and most dangerous of all errors to this day was a dogmatist’s error, namely Plato’s invention of pure spirit and the Good in itself"
"But now that it has been overcome, and Europe breathes a sigh of relief after this nightmare, and at least can enjoy a healthier - well - sleep, we, whose task is wakefulness itself are the heirs to all the force cultivated through the struggle against this error"
"Of course: talking about spirit and the Good like Plato did meant standing truth on its head and disowning even perspectivism , which is the fundamental condition of all life"
") But we, who are neither Jesuits nor democrats, nor even German enough, we good Europeans and free, very free spirits - we still have it, the whole need of spirit and the whole tension of its bow! And perhaps the arrow too, the task, and - who knows? the goal"
"We asked about the value of this will"
"Granted, we will truth: why not untruth instead? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the value of truth came before us, - or was it we who came before the problem? Which of us is Oedipus? Which one is the Sphinx? It seems we have a rendezvous of questions and question-marks"
"- And, believe it or not, it ultimately looks to us as if the problem has never been raised until now, - as if we were the first to ever see it, fix our gaze on it, risk it"
"Because this involves risk and perhaps no risk has ever been greater"
"Things of the highest value must have another, separate origin of their own , - they cannot be derived from this ephemeral, seductive, deceptive, lowly world, from this mad chaos of con- fusion and desire"
"From these 'beliefs' they try to acquire their 'knowledge,' to acquire something that will end up being solemnly christened as 'the truth"
"' The fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in oppositions of values"
"It has not occurred to even the most cautious of them to start doubting right here at the threshold, where it is actually needed the most - even though they had vowed to themselves u de omnibus dubitandum"
"' 2 But we can doubt, first, whether opposites even exist and, second, whether the popular valuations and value oppositions that have earned the metaphysicians’ seal of approval might not only be foreground appraisals"
"Perhaps they are merely provisional perspectives, perhaps they are not even viewed head-on; perhaps they are even viewed from below, like a frog-perspective, to borrow an expression that painters will recognize"
"Whatever value might be attributed to truth, truthfulness, and selflessness, it could be possible that appearance, the will to deception, and craven self-interest should be accorded a higher and more fundamen- tal value for all life"
"It could even be possible that whatever gives value to those good and honorable things has an incriminating link, bond, or tie to the very things that look like their evil opposites; perhaps they are even essentially the same"
"Perhaps! - But who is willing to take charge of such a dangerous Perhaps! For this we must await the arrival of a new breed of philosophers, ones whose taste and inclination are somehow the reverse of those we have seen so far - philosophers of the dangerous Per- haps in every sense"
"- And in all seriousness: I see these new philosophers approaching"

"6   On the prejudices of philosophers  must still be attributed to instinctive activity, and this is even the case for philosophical thought"
"This issue needs re-examination in the same way that heredity and 'innate characteristics' have been re-examined"
"Just as the act of birth makes no difference to the overall course of heredity, neither is 'consciousness' opposed to instinct in any decisive sense - most of a philosopher’s conscious thought is secretly directed and forced into determinate channels by the instincts"
"Even behind all logic and its au- tocratic posturings stand valuations or, stated more clearly, physiological requirements for the preservation of a particular type of life"
"But this assumes that it is not man who is the 'measure of things'"
"4  We do not consider the falsity of a judgment as itself an objection to a judg- ment; this is perhaps where our new language will sound most foreign"
"The question is how far the judgment promotes and preserves life, how well it preserves, and perhaps even cultivates, the type"
"To acknowledge untruth as a condition of life: this clearly means resisting the usual value feelings in a dangerous manner; and a philoso- phy that risks such a thing would by that gesture alone place itself beyond good and evil"
"5  What goads us into regarding all philosophers with an equal measure of mistrust and mockery is not that we are struck repeatedly by how innocent  3 Silliness"
"Because every drive craves mastery, and this leads it to try philosophizing"
"In contrast, there is absolutely nothing impersonal about the philosopher; and in particular his morals bear de- cided and decisive witness to who he is - which means, in what order of rank the innermost drives of his nature stand with respect to each other"
"7  How malicious philosophers can be! I do not know anything more ven- omous than the joke Epicurus allowed himself against Plato and the Platonists: he called them Dionysiokolakes"
"4 Literally, the foreground meaning of this term is 'sycophants of Dionysus' and therefore acces- sories of the tyrant and brown-nosers; but it also wants to say 'they’re all actors , there’s nothing genuine about them' (since Dionysokolax was a popular term for an actor)"
"9   Beyond Good and Evil  who knows? perhaps out of anger and ambition against Plato? - It took a hundred years for Greece to find out who this garden god Epicurus had been"
"- Did it find out?  8  In every philosophy there is a point where the philosopher’s 'conviction' steps onto the stage: or, to use the language of an ancient Mystery:  adventavit asinus pulcher et fortissimus"

"Now it is beginning to dawn on maybe five or six brains that physics too is only an interpretation and arrangement of the world (according to ourselves! if I may say so) and not an explanation of the world"

"What is plain, what 'explains'? Only what can be seen and felt, - this is as far as any problem has to be pursued"
"Conversely: the strong attraction of the Platonic way of thinking consisted in its opposition to precisely this empiricism"
"It was a noble way of thinking, suitable perhaps for people who enjoyed even stronger and more discriminating senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in staying master over these senses"
"And they did this by throwing drab, cold, gray nets of concepts over the brightly colored whirlwind of the senses - the rabble of the senses, as Plato said"

"18  That a theory is refutable is, frankly, not the least of its charms: this is precisely how it attracts the more refined intellects"
"The theory of 'free will,' which has been refuted a hundred times, appears to owe its endurance to this charm alone -: somebody will always come along and feel strong enough to refute it"
"19  Philosophers tend to talk about the will as if it were the most familiar thing in the world"
"In fact, Schopenhauer would have us believe that the will is the only thing that is really familiar, familiar through and through, familiar without pluses or minuses"
"But I have always thought that, here too, Schopenhauer was only doing what philosophers always tend to do: adopting and exaggerating a popular prejudice"
"Willing strikes me as, above all, something complicated , something unified only in a word - and this single word contains the popular prejudice that has overruled whatever minimal precautions philosophers might take"
"So let us be more cautious, for once - let us be 'unphilosophical"
"' Let us say: in every act of willing there is, to begin with, a plurality of feelings, namely: the feeling of the state away from which, the feeling of the state towards which, and the feeling of this 'away from' and 'towards' themselves"
"But this is accompanied by a feeling of the muscles that comes into play through a sort of habit as soon as we 'will,' even without our putting 'arms and legs' into motion"
"Just as feeling - and indeed many feelings - must be recognized as ingredients of the will, thought must be as well"
"A person who wills — , commands something inside himself that obeys, or that he believes to obey"
"But now we notice the strangest thing about the will - about this multifarious thing that people have only one word for"
"On the one hand, we are, under the circumstances, both the one who commands and the one who obeys, and as the obedient one we are familiar with the feelings of compulsion, force, pressure, resistance, and motion that generally start right after the act of willing"
"On the other hand, however, we are in the habit of ignoring and deceiving ourselves about this duality by means of the synthetic concept of the 'I"
"' As a result, a whole chain of erroneous conclusions, and, consequently, false evaluations have become attached to the will, — to such an extent that the one who wills believes, in good faith, that willing suffices for action"
"Since it is almost always the case that there is will only where the effect of command, and therefore obedience, and therefore action, may be expected , the appearance translates into the feeling, as if there were a necessity of effect"
"In short, the one who wills believes with a reasonable degree of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he attributes the success, the performance of the willing to the will itself, and consequently enjoys an increase in the feeling of power that accompanies all success"
"'Freedom of the will' - that is the word for the multi-faceted state of pleasure of one who commands and, at the same time, identifies himself with the accomplished act of willing"
"As such, he enjoys the triumph over resistances, but thinks to himself that it was his will alone that truly overcame the resistance"

"Under an invisible spell, they will each start out anew, only to end up revolving in the same orbit once again"
"In fact, their thinking is not nearly as much a discovery as it is a recognition, remembrance, a returning and homecoming into a distant, primordial, total economy of the soul, from which each concept once grew: - to this extent, philosophizing is a type of atavism of the highest order"

"21  The causa sui 19 is the best self-contradiction that has ever been conceived, a type of logical rape and abomination"
"But humanity’s excessive pride has got itself profoundly and horribly entangled with precisely this piece of nonsense"
"In the 'in-itself' there is nothing like 'causal association,' 'necessity,' or 'psychological un-freedom"
"' There, the 'effect' does not follow 'from the cause,' there is no rule of 'law"
"' li e are the ones who invented causation, succession, for-each-other, rel- ativity, compulsion, numbers, law, freedom, grounds, purpose; and if we project and inscribe this symbol world onto things as an 'in-itself,' then this is the way we have always done things, namely mythologically"
"The 'un-free will' is mythology; in real life it is only a matter of strong and weak wills"
"It is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in a thinker when he senses some compulsion, need, having-to-follow, pressure, un- freedom in every 'causal connection' and 'psychological necessity"
"' It is  19 Cause of itself"
"21   Beyond Good and Evil  very telling to feel this way - the person tells on himself"
"And in general, if I have observed correctly, 'un-freedom of the will' is regarded as a problem by two completely opposed parties, but always in a profoundly personal manner"
"The one party would never dream of relinquishing their 'responsibility,' a belief in themselves , a personal right to their own merit (the vain races belong to this group -)"
"Those in the other party, on the contrary, do not want to be responsible for anything or to be guilty of anything; driven by an inner self-contempt, they long to be able to shift the blame for themselves to something else"
"When they write books these days, this latter group tends to side with the criminal; a type of socialist pity is their most attractive disguise"
"And, in fact, the fatalism of the weak of will starts to look surprisingly attractive when it can present itself as u la religion de la soujfrance humaine ': 20 this is its 'good taste"
"'  22  You must forgive an old philologist like me who cannot help maliciously putting his finger on bad tricks of interpretation: but this 'conformity of nature to law,' which you physicists are so proud of, just as if — exists only because of your interpretation and bad 'philology"
"This sort of interpreter would show the unequivocal and unconditional nature of all 'will to power' so vividly and graphically that almost every word, and even the word 'tyranny,' would ultimately seem useless or like weakening and mollifying metaphors - and too humanizing"
"Yet this  20 The religion of human suffering"

"Granted, this is only an interpretation too - and you will be eager enough to make this objection? — well then, so much the better"
"23  All psychology so far has been stuck in moral prejudices and fears: it has not ventured into the depths"
"The power of moral prejudice has deeply affected the most spiritual world, which seems like the coldest world, the one most likely to be devoid of any presuppositions - and the effect has been manifestly harmful, hindering, dazzling, and distorting"
"A genuine physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious resistances in the heart of the researcher, it has 'the heart' against it"
"Even a doctrine of the reciprocal dependence of the 'good' and the 'bad' drives will (as a refined immorality) cause distress and aversion in a strong and sturdy conscience - as will, to an even greater extent, a doctrine of the derivation of all the good drives from the bad"

"It’s just that, with this sort of wish we have to be clear about what we will be seeing: - only a satyr-play, only a satirical epilogue, only the continuing proof that the long, real tragedy has come to an end (assuming that every philosophy was originally a long tragedy - )"
"26  Every choice human being strives instinctively for a citadel and secrecy where he is rescued from the crowds, the many, the vast majority; where, as the exception, he can forget the human norm"
"The only exception is when he is driven straight towards this norm by an even stronger instinct, in search of knowledge in the great and exceptional sense"
"Anybody who, in dealing with people, does not occasionally glisten in all the shades of distress, green and gray with disgust, weariness, pity, gloominess, and loneliness - he is certainly not a person of higher taste"
"But if he does not freely take on all this effort and pain, if he keeps avoiding it and remains, as I said, placid and proud and hidden in his citadel, well then one thing is certain: he is not made for knowledge, not predestined for it"
"Because if he were, he would eventually have to say to himself: 'To hell with good taste! The norm is more interesting than the exception - than me, the exception!' - and he would wend his way downwards , and, above all, 'inwards"
"But if he is lucky, as befits knowledge’s child of fortune, the philosopher will find real shortcuts and aids to make his work easier"
"I mean he will find so-called cynics - people who easily recognize the animal, the commonplace, the 'norm' within themselves, and yet still have a degree of spiritedness and  27   Beyond Good and Evil  an urge to talk about themselves and their peers in front of witnesses-"

"Cynicism is the only form in which base souls touch upon that thing which is genuine honesty"
"And the higher man needs to open his ears to all cynicism, crude or refined, and congratulate himself every time the buffoon speaks up without shame, or the scientific satyr is heard right in front of him"
"There are even cases where enchantment mixes with disgust: namely, where genius, by a whim of nature, is tied to some indiscreet billy-goat and ape, like the Abbe Galiani, the most profound, discerning, and perhaps also the filthiest man of his century"
"He was much more profound than Voltaire, and consequently a lot quieter"
"But, as I have already suggested, what happens more often is that the scientific head is placed on an ape’s body, a more subtle and exceptional understanding is put in a base soul"
"This is not a rare phenomenon, particularly among physicians and phys- iologists of morals"
"He should keep his ears open wherever people are speaking without anger"
"Because the angry man, and anyone who is constantly tearing and shredding himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, or God, or society), may very well stand higher than the laughing and self- satisfied satyr, considered morally"

"And, above all, we become partisan, partisan on principle against 'youth"
"' - A decade later, we realize that all this - was youthfulness too!  32  During the longest epoch of human history (which is called the prehistoric age) an action’s value or lack of value was derived from its consequences; the action itself was taken as little into account as its origin"
"Instead, the situation was something like that of present-day China, where the honor or dishonor of a child reflects back on the parents"
"In the same way, it was the retroactive force of success or failure that showed peo- ple whether to think of an action as good or bad"
"We can call this pe- riod the pre-moral period of humanity"
"At that point, the imperative 'know thyself!' was still unknown"
"By contrast, over the course of the last ten millennia, people across a large part of the earth have gradually come far enough to see the origin, not the consequence, as decisive for the value of an action"
"By and large, this was a great event, a consider- able refinement of outlook and criterion, an unconscious after-effect of the dominance of aristocratic values and the belief in 'origin,' and the sign of a period that we can signify as moral in a narrow sense"
"This marks the first attempt at self-knowledge"
"Origin rather than consequence: what a reversal of perspective! And, certainly, this reversal was only accomplished after long struggles and fluctuations! Granted: this meant that a disastrous  32   The free spirit  new superstition, a distinctive narrowness of interpretation gained domi- nance"

"People were united in the be- lief that the value of an action was exhausted by the value of its intention"
"Intention as the entire origin and prehistory of an action: under this pre- judice people have issued moral praise, censure, judgment, and philoso- phy almost to this day"
"We believe that morality in the sense it has had up to now (the morality of intentions) was a prejudice, a precipitousness, perhaps a preliminary, a thing on about the same level as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something that must be overcome"

"'Will' can naturally have effects only on 'will' — and not on 'matter' (not on 'nerves' for instance -)"

"Furthermore, the sight of the saint made them suspicious: 'No one would desire such a monstrosity of negation, of anti-nature, for nothing,' they said to (and asked of) themselves"
"They had to ask him  52  The Jewish 'Old Testament,' the book of divine justice, has people, things, and speeches in such grand style that it is without parallel in the written works of Greece and India"

"The worst part of it is: he seems unable to communicate in an intelligible manner: is he unclear? - After hearing, questioning, dis- cussing many things, these are the causes I have found for the decline of European theism"
"It seems to me that the religious instinct is indeed grow- ing vigorously - but that it rejects any specifically theistic gratification with profound distrust"
"54  So what is really going on with the whole of modern philosophy? Since Descartes (and, in fact, in spite of him more than because of him) all the philosophers have been out to assassinate the old concept of the soul, under the guise of critiquing the concepts of subject and predicate"
"In other words, they have been out to assassinate the fundamental presupposition of the Christian doctrine"
"As a sort of epistemological skepticism, modern philosophy is, covertly or overtly, anti-Christian (although, to state the point for more subtle ears, by no means anti-religious)"
"People used to believe in 'the soul' as they believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: people said that 'I' was a condition and 'think' was a predicate and conditioned - thinking is an activity, and a subject must be thought of as its cause"
"Now, with admirable tenacity and cunning, people are wondering whether they can get out of this net - wondering whether the reverse might be true: that 'think' is the condition and 'I' is conditioned, in which case 'I' would be a synthesis that only gets produced through thought itself"
"Kant essentially wanted to prove that the subject cannot be proven on the basis of the subject - and neither can the object"
"The possibility that the subject (and therefore 'the soul') has a merely apparent existence might not always have been foreign to him, this thought that,  49   Beyond Good and Evil  in the form of the Vedanta philosophy, has already arisen on earth once before and with enormous power"
"55  There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, and, of its many rungs, three are the most important"
"Then, during the moral epoch of humanity, people sacri- ficed the strongest instincts they had, their 'nature,' to their god; the joy of this particular festival shines in the cruel eyes of the ascetic, that enthu- siastic piece of 'anti-nature"
"Perhaps everything the mind’s eye has used to quicken its wit and deepen its understanding was really just a chance to practice, a piece of fun, something for children and childish people"

"' They do not seem to have any time to spare for religion, particularly when it is unclear to them whether it would be a new business or a new pleasure - 'since people can’t possibly be going to church just to spoil a good mood,' they tell themselves"
"People who are devout or even just church-goers will rarely imagine how much goodwill (or may be 'whimsical will') is required for a German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously"
"Only with the help of history (and therefore not on the basis of his personal experience) does the scholar succeed in approaching religion with a reverential seriousness and a certain cautious consideration"
"But even if he reaches the point where he feels grateful for religion, he does not come a single step closer to what still passes for church or piety: possibly even the reverse"
"An instinct of preservation has taught people to be flighty, light, and false"
"We occasionally find both philosophers and artists engaging in a passionate and exaggerated worship of 'pure forms"
"' Let there be no doubt that anyone who needs the cult of the surface this badly has at some point reached beneath the surface with disastrous results"
"Perhaps there is even an order of rank for these wounded children, the born artists, who find pleasure in life only by intending to falsify its image, in a sort of prolonged revenge against life -"
"We can infer the degree to which life has been spoiled for them from the extent to which they want to see its image distorted, diluted, deified, and cast into the beyond - considered as artists, the homines religiosi 11 would belong to the highest rank"
"Seen in this light, piety - the 'life in God' - appears as the last and most subtle monstrosity produced by fear of the truth; it appears as the artists’ worship and intoxication before the most consistent of all falsifications, as the will to invert the truth, the will to untruth at any price"
"Perhaps piety has been the most potent method yet for the beautification of humanity: it can turn people into art, surface, plays of colors, benevolence, and to such an extent that we can finally look at them without suffering"

"The influence that can be exerted over selection and breeding with the help of religions (and this influence is always just as destructive as it is creative and formative) varies according to the type of person who falls under their spell and protec- tion"
"For people who are strong, independent, prepared, and predestined for command, people who come to embody the reason and art of a gov- erning race, religion is an additional means of overcoming resistances, of being able to rule"
"It binds the ruler together with the ruled, giving and handing the consciences of the ruled over to the rulers - which is to say: handing over their hidden and most interior aspect, and one which would very much like to escape obedience"
"This is how the Brahmins, for instance, un- derstood the matter"
"With the help of a religious organization, they as- sumed the power to appoint kings for the people, while they themselves kept and felt removed and outside, a people of higher, over-kingly tasks"
"54   The religious character  Meanwhile, religion also gives some fraction of the ruled the instruction and opportunity they need to prepare for eventual rule and command"
"This is particularly true for that slowly ascending class and station in which, through fortunate marriage practices, the strength and joy of the will, the will to self-control is always on the rise"
"Religion tempts and urges them to take the path to higher spirituality and try out feelings of great self-overcoming, of silence, and of solitude"
"Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race that wants to gain control over its origins among the rabble, and work its way up to eventual rule"
"Religion, and the meaning religion gives to life, spreads sunshine over such eternally tormented people and makes them bearable even to themselves"
"It has the same effect that an Epicurean philosophy usually has on the suffering of higher ranks: it refreshes, refines, and makes the most of suffering, as it were"
"In the end it even sanctifies and justifies"
"With humans as with every other type of animal, there is a surplus of fail- ures and degenerates, of the diseased and infirm, of those who necessarily suffer"
"Even with humans, successful cases are always the exception and,  55   Beyond Good and Evil  since humans are the still undetermined animals , the infrequent exception"
"But it gets worse: people who represent more nobly bred types are less likely to turn out well"
"Chance, that law of nonsense in the overall economy of mankind, is most terribly apparent in its destructive effect on the higher men, whose conditions of life are subtle, multiple, and difficult to calcu- late"
"So how is this surplus of failures treated by the two greatest religions, those mentioned above? They try to preserve, to keep everything living that can be kept in any way alive"
"In fact, they take sides with the failures as a matter of principle, as religions of the suffering"
"They give rights to all those who suffer life like a disease, and they want to make every other feeling for life seem wrong and become impossible"
"They have preserved too much of what should be destroyed"
"If you could survey the strangely painful, crude yet subtle comedy of European Christianity with the mocking and disinterested eye of an Epicurean god, I think you would  56   The religious character  find it to be a constant source of amazement and laughter"

"Of course, people have not generally been this modest"
"Philosophers have all demanded (with ridiculously stubborn seriousness) something much more exalted, ambitious, and solemn as soon as they took up morality as a science: they wanted morality to be grounded, - and every philosopher so far has thought that he has provided a ground for morality"
"Morality itself, however, was thought to be 'given"
"' What a distance between this sort of crass pride and that supposedly modest little descriptive project, left in rot and ruin, even though the subtlest hands and senses could hardly be subtle enough for it"
"As strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been missing from every 'science of morals' so far: there was no suspicion that anything was really a problem"
"Viewed properly, the 'grounding of morals' (as philosophers called it, as they demanded it of themselves) was only an erudite form of good faith in the dominant morality, a new way of expressing it; as such, it was itself already situated within the terms of a certain morality"
"In the last analysis, it even constitutes a type of denial that these morals can be regarded as a problem"
"But, in any event, it is the opposite of an examination, dissection, interrogation, vivisection of pre- cisely this article of faith"

"Admittedly, this also entailed an irreplaceable loss of force and spirit, which have had to be crushed, stifled, and ruined (since here, just like everywhere else, 'nature,' shows itself in its utterly wasteful and indifferent glory, which is outrageous but noble)"
"Slavery, in both the crude and refined senses of the term, seems to be the indispensable means of disciplining and breeding even the spirit"

"Some philosophical sects can be interpreted in this way as well (like the Stoa in the midst of a Hellenistic culture whose air had become heavy and lascivious with the fragrance of aphrodisiacs)"

"The oddly limited character of human development - its hesitancy and lengthi- ness, its frequent regressions and reversals - is due to the fact that the herd instinct of obedience is inherited the best and at the cost of the art of commanding"

"These types belong together and derive from the same set of causes"
"11 Ultimately, the 'love of the neighbor' is always somewhat conventional, willfully feigned and beside the point compared to fear of the neighbor"
"After the structure of society seems on the whole to be established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of the neighbor that again creates new perspectives of moral valuation"
"Now, however, since there are no more escape valves for these drives, they are seen as twice as dangerous and, one by one, they are denounced as immoral and abandoned to slander"
"Now the opposite drives and inclinations come into moral favor; step by step, the herd instinct draws its conclusion"

"Everything that raises the individual over the herd and frightens the neighbor will henceforth be called evil ; the proper, modest, unobtrusive, equalizing attitude and the mediocrity of desires acquire moral names and honors"
"Finally, in very peaceable circumstances there are fewer and fewer opportunities and less and less need to nurture an instinct for severity or hardness; and now every severity starts disturbing the conscience, even where justice is concerned"
"A high and hard nobility and self-reliance is almost offensive, and provokes suspicion; 'the lamb,' and 'the sheep' even more, gains respect"
"- There is a point in the history of a society when it becomes pathologically enervated and tenderized and it takes sides, quite honestly and earnestly, with those who do it harm, with criminals"
"Punishment: that seems somehow unjust to this society, - it certainly finds the thoughts of 'punishment' and 'needing to punish' both painful and frightening"
"'Isn’t it enough to render him unthreatening ? Why punish him as well? Punishment is itself fearful!' - with these questions, the herd morality, the morality of timidity, draws its final consequences"
"202  Let us immediately repeat what we have already said a hundred times before, since there are no ready ears for such truths - for our truths - these days"
"We know all too well how offensive it sounds when someone classifies human beings as animals, without disguises or allegory; and we are considered almost sinful for constantly using expressions like 'herd,' and 'herd instinct' with direct reference to people of 'modern ideas"

"Europe, we have found, has become unanimous in all major  89   Beyond Good and Evil  moral judgments; and this includes the countries under Europe’s influ- ence"
"People in Europe clearly know what Socrates claimed not to know, and what that famous old snake once promised to teach, - people these days 'know' what is good and evil"
"Moral- ity in Europe these days is the morality of herd animals'"
"- and therefore, as we understand things, it is only one type of human morality beside which, before which, and after which many other (and especially higher) moralities are or should be possible"
"But there are indications that the tempo of this morality is still much too slow and lethargic for those who have less patience, those who are sick or addicted to the above-mentioned instinct"
"'Away with all masters!' - that’s what the rabble instinct wants, even here"
"My memory (the memory of a scientific man, if you will!) is teeming with the arrogantly naive comments about philosophy and philosophers that I have heard from young natural scientists and old physicians (not to  1 'Showing one’s wounds"

"Sometimes it was that color-blindness of utilitarian-minded people who considered philosophy to be just a series of refuted systems and a waste- ful expenditure that never did anybody 'any good"
"’’ Sometimes a fear of disguised mysticism and changes to the limits of knowledge sprang up; at other times, there was disdain for particular philosophers that had unwit- tingly become a disdain for philosophy in general"
"In the end, I have found that what usually lies behind young scholars’ arrogant devalorizations of philosophy is the nasty after-effect of some philosopher himself"
"These scholars had, for the most part, stopped listening to this philosopher, but without having emerged from under the spell of his dismissive valuations of other philosophers: - and this resulted in a generalized ill will against all philosophy"
"But Schopenhauer was himself impoverished, insensitive, un-German to the point of genius on precisely this point"
") Looking at the overall picture, the damage done to the respectability of philosophy might be primarily due to the human, all-too-human, and, in short, miserable condition of more recent philosophy itself, which has held open the door to the rabble instinct"
"And  2 Leisure"
"94   We scholars  especially those hodgepodge philosophers who call themselves 'philoso- phers of reality' or 'positivists' — just the sight of them is enough to instill a dangerous mistrust in the soul of an ambitious young scholar"
"In the end: how could it be any other way! Science is thriving these days, its good conscience shines in its face; meanwhile whatever state recent philosophy has gradually sunk to, whatever is left of philosophy today, inspires mis- trust and displeasure, if not ridicule and pity"
"How could such a philosophy - dominate ?  205  There are so many different kinds of dangers involved in the development of a philosopher these days that it can be doubted whether this fruit is still capable of ripening at all"
"The height and width of the tower of science have grown to be so monstrously vast that the philosopher is that much more likely to become exhausted before he has even finished his education, or to let himself grab hold of something and 'specialize"
"' And so he is never at his best, never reaches a high point in his development from which he would be able to look over, look around, and look down"
"Or he gets there too late, when he is already past his prime and his strength has started to fade; or he gets there disabled, having become coarse and degenerate, so that his gaze, his overall value judgment is largely meaningless"
"In the end, this is a question of taste, even if it is not a question of conscience"
"And just to double the philosopher’s difficulties again, there is the additional fact that he demands a judgment of himself, a Yes or a No, not about science but about life and the value of life"
"In fact, the masses have misjudged and mistaken the philosopher for a long time, sometimes confusing him with the scientific man and ideal scholar, and sometimes with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized enthusiasts and intoxicated men of God"
"If you hear anyone praised these days for living 'wisely' or 'like a philosopher' it basically just means he is 'clever and keeps out of the way"
"' To the rabble, wisdom seems like a kind of escape, a device or trick for pulling yourself out of the game when things get rough"
"206  Compared to a genius, which is to say: compared to a being that either begets or gives birth (taking both words in their widest scope -), the scholar, the average man of science, is somewhat like an old maid"
"Like her, he has no expertise in the two most valuable acts performed by humanity"
"And, as a sort of compensation, both the scholar and the old maid are admitted to be respectable - respectability is always emphasized - although in both cases we are annoyed by the obligatory nature of this admission"
"Let us look more closely: what is the scientific man? In the first place, he is an ignoble type of person with the virtues that an ignoble type will have: this type is not dominant, authoritative, or self-sufficient"
"He is industrious, he is patiently lined up in an orderly array, he is regular and moderate in his abilities and needs, he has an instinct for his own kind and for the needs of his kind"
"These needs include: that piece of  3 In German: Versuchen und Versuchungen (see note 16, p"
"39 above)"
"It is only fair that the scholar has the diseases and bad habits of an ignoble type as well"
"He is full of petty jealousies and has eyes like a hawk for the base aspects of natures whose heights he cannot attain"
"The worst and most dangerous thing that a scholar is capable of doing comes from his type’s instinct for mediocrity: from that Jesuitism of mediocrity that instinctively works towards the annihilation of the exceptional man and tries to break every taut bow or - even better! — to unbend it"
"Unbending it with consideration, and, of course, a gentle hand -, unbending it with friendly pity: that is the true art of Jesuitism, which has always known how to introduce itself as a religion of pity"
"This kind of thing tends to happen within the pessimist school, which has reasons of its own for regarding 'disinterested know- ing' with the greatest respect"

"' He waits until something comes along and then spreads himself gently towards it, so that even light footsteps and the passing by of a ghostly being are not lost on his surface and skin"
"He has so thoroughly become a passageway and reflection of strange shapes and events, that whatever is left in him of a 'person' strikes him as accidental, often arbitrary, and still more often as disruptive"
"It takes an effort for him to think back on 'himself,' and he is not infrequently mistaken when he does"
"He easily confuses himself with others, he is wrong about his own basic needs, and this is the only respect in which he is crude and careless"
"He has lost any serious engagement with the issue as well as the time to spend on it: he is cheerful, not for lack of needs but for lack of hands to grasp his neediness"
"If you want him to love or hate (I mean love and hate as a god, woman, or animal would understand the terms -) he will do what he can and give what he can"
"But do not be surprised if it is not much, - if this is where he comes across as fake, fragile, questionable, and brittle"
"His love is forced, his hatred artificial and more like un tour de force , a little piece of vanity and exagger- ation"
"He is sincere only to the extent that he is allowed to be objective: he is 'nature' and 'natural' only in his cheerful totality"

"In general, he puts himself at too great a distance to have any basis for choosing between good or evil"
"He is not a conclusion - and still less a beginning, begetter or first cause; there is nothing tough, powerful or self-supporting that wants to dominate"
"Rather, he is only a gentle, brushed-off, refined, agile pot of forms, who first has to wait for some sort of content or substance in order 'to shape' himself accordingly, - he is generally a man without substance or content, a 'selfless' man"
"And consequently, in parenthesi , nothing for women"

"His conscience has been trained to jump at every no, or even at a decisive and hardened yes, and to feel it like a bite"
"Yes! and No! - this is contrary to morality, as far as he is concerned"
"Conversely, he loves to treat his virtues to a feast of noble abstinence, when, for instance, he says, with Montaigne: 'What do I know?' Or with Socrates: 'I know that I don’t know anything"
"' Or 'I don’t trust myself here, there aren’t any doors open to me"

"Skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain complex physiological condition which in layman’s terms is called weak nerves or a sickly constitution"
"It originates whenever races or classes that have been separated for a long time are suddenly and decisively interbred"
"The different standards and values, as it were, get passed down through the bloodline to the next generation where everything is in a state of restlessness, disorder, doubt, experimen- tation"
"The best forces have inhibitory effects, the virtues themselves do not let each other strengthen and grow, both body and soul lack a cen- ter of balance, a center of gravity and the assurance of a pendulum"
"But what is most profoundly sick and degenerate about such hybrids is the will', they no longer have any sense of independence in decision-making, or the bold feeling of pleasure in willing, - they doubt whether there is 'freedom of will,' even in their dreams"
"And most of what presents itself in the shop windows these days as 'objectivity,' for instance, or 'scientihcity,' ' I’art pour l ’art ,' 9 or 'pure, will-less knowing,' is only dressed-up skepticism and paralysis of the will, - I will vouch for this diagnosis of the European disease"
"- The disease of the will has spread unevenly across Europe"
"It appears greatest and most varied where the culture has been at home for the longest period of time; and it becomes increasingly faint to the extent that 'the barbarian' still - or once again - asserts his rights under the sagging robes of occidental cultivation"
"This is why the will is most sick in present-day France, a fact which can be logically concluded as easily as it can be palpably felt"
"France has always had the brilliant historical sense to turn even disastrous changes of its spirit into something charming and seductive"
"Now, it clearly indicates its culturally dominant position within Europe by being the school and showcase for all the magic spells of skepticism"
"The strength to will and, in fact, a will to will at length, is somewhat more vigorous in Germany, and stronger in the north of Germany than in the center"
"It is consider- ably stronger in England, Spain, and Corsica; in one place it is bound up with apathy, in another, with hard heads, - not to mention Italy, which is too young to know what it wants, and which first needs to prove that it can will -"
"But it is the strongest of all and the most amazing in that vast intermediary zone where Europe, as it were, flows back into Asia: in Russia"
"There, the strength to will has been laid aside and stored up over a long time; there, the will is waiting threateningly (uncertain whether as a will of negation or of affirmation), to be discharged (to borrow a favorite term from today’s physicists)"

"Mean- while, however, a harsher and more dangerous new type of skepticism was growing in his son (and who knows how much it was encouraged precisely by his father’s hatred and the icy melancholy of an isolated will?) - the  10 Frederick William I"
"102   We scholars  skepticism of a bold masculinity, which is most closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and which first entered Germany in the shape of the great Frederick"
"This skepticism despises and nevertheless appropri- ates; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe but does not die out on this account; it gives the spirit a dangerous freedom, but is severe on the heart"
"The German form of skepticism (being a continued Frederickianism that has been intensified to the most spiritual degree) has put Europe under the dominion of German spirit with its critical and historical mistrust for a long time"

"They could be called critics with equal justification; and they will certainly be engaged in experiments"
"I mean: the certainty of value standards, the conscious implementation of a unity of method, a sly courage, a solitary stance, and capacity for responsibility"
"In fact, these philosophers admit to taking pleasure in saying no, in dissecting, and in a certain level-headed cruelty that knows how to guide a knife with assurance and subtlety, even when the heart is bleeding"
"They will be more severe (and perhaps not always with themselves alone) than humane people might wish them to be"
"They will not engage with 'truth' in such a way that it 'pleases' or 'elevates' or 'inspires' them; they will hardly believe that the truth , of all things, would keep the feelings this amused"
"These philosophers of the future will demand (and not only of themselves) critical discipline and every habit that leads to cleanliness and rigor in matters of the spirit"
"They might even wear these  104   We scholars  like a type of jewel they have on display, - nevertheless, they still do not want to be called critics"
"-  21 1  I am going to insist that people finally stop mistaking philosophical la- borers and scientific men in general for philosophers, - that here, of all places, people be strict about giving 'each his due' and not too much to the one, and much too little to the other"
"In the course of his education, the genuine philosopher might have been required to stand on each of the steps where his servants, the philosophical scientific laborers, have come to a stop, - have had to come to a stop"
"But all these are only preconditions for his task: the task itself has another wifi, - it calls for him to create values"
"It is up to these researchers to make everything that has happened or been valued so far look clear, obvious, comprehensible, and manageable, to ab- breviate everything long, even 'time' itself, and to overwhelm the entire past"
"This is an enormous and wonderful task, in whose service any subtle  15 An allusion to Kant, who spent his life in Konigsberg"
"105   Beyond Good and Evil  pride or tough will can certainly find satisfaction"
"But true philosophers are commanders and legislators', they say 'That is how it should be!' they are the ones who first determine the 'where to?' and 'what for?' of people, which puts at their disposal the preliminary labor of all philosophical la- borers, all those who overwhelm the past"
"True philosophers reach for the future with a creative hand and everything that is and was becomes a means, a tool, a hammer for them"
"Their 'knowing' is creating , their creating is a legislating, their will to truth is - will to power"
"- Are there philosophers like this today? Have there ever been philosophers like this? Won’t there have to he philosophers like this?"
"212  It seems increasingly clear to me that the philosopher, being necessarily a person of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, has, in every age, been and has needed to be at odds with his today: his enemy has always been the ideal of today"
"In applying a vivisecting knife directly to the chest of the virtues of the age , they gave away their own secret: to know a new greatness in humanity, a new, untraveled path to human greatness"
"Every time they have done this, they have shown how much hypocrisy and laziness, how much letting yourself go and letting go of yourself, how many lies are hidden beneath the most highly honored type of their present-day morality, and how much virtue is out of date"
"Every time, they have said: 'We need to go there, out there, out where you feel least at home today"
"He would determine even value and rank according to how much and how many things someone could carry and take upon himself, how far someone could stretch his responsibility"
"With equal justice, the opposite doctrine and the ideal of a stupid, self-abnegating, humble, selfless humanity was suited to an opposite age, to an age like the sixteenth century that suffered from its accumulated energy of the will and from the most savage Hoods and storm tides of egoism"
"And the philosopher will be revealing something of his own ideal when he proposes: 'Greatest of all is the one who can be the most solitary, the most hidden, the most different, the person beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, the one with an abundance of will"
"Only this should be called greatness : the ability to be just as multiple as whole, just as wide as full"
"' And to ask once again: is greatness possible today?  213  It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: you have to 'know' by experience, - or you should be proud that you do not know it at all"
"But nowadays everyone talks about things that they cannot experience, and most especially (and most terribly) when it comes to philosophers and philosophical matters"
"Hardly anyone knows about them or is allowed to know, and all popular opinions about them are false"
"They think of every necessity as a need, a painstaking having-to-follow and being-forced; and they consider thinking itself as something slow and sluggish, almost a toil and often enough 'worth the sweat of the noble"
"' Not in their wildest dreams would they think of it as light, divine, and closely related to dance and high spirits! 'Thinking' and 'treating an issue seriously,' 'with gravity' - these belong together, according to most thinkers and scholars: that is the only way they have 'experienced' it -"

"— Oh! If you knew how soon, so soon now - things will be different!"
"216  To love your enemies? I think this has been learned quite well: it happens thousands of times these days, in large and small ways; in fact, something even higher and more sublime happens every once in a while - we learn to despise when we love and precisely when we love the most"
"But all of this is unconscious, noiseless, lacking in pomp or pageantry but possessing that shame and concealed goodness which forbids the mouth from using any solemn words or virtuous formulas"
"Morality as posturing - offends our taste these days"
"This is progress too, just as it was progress for our fathers when religion as posturing finally offended their taste, including the hostility and Voltairean bitterness towards religion (and everything that used to belong to the sign language of free spirits)"
"No puritan litany, moral homily, or petty bourgeois respectability wants to resonate with the music in our conscience and the dance in our spirit"
"' Blessed are the forgetful: for they will 'have done' with their stupidities too"
"218  The French psychologists - and where else are there still psychologists today? - have never grown tired of their bitter and manifold delight in  no   Our virtues  the betise bourgeoises somewhat as if"
"enough, this reveals something about them"
"For instance, Flaubert, the good citizen of Rouen, ultimately stopped seeing, hearing, or tasting anything else: this was his brand of self-torture and subtler cruelty"
"In short, you psychologists should study the philosophy of the 'rule' in its struggle against the 'exception': there you will see drama good enough for gods and divine malice! Or, to be even more up to date: vivisect the 'good man,' the ' homo bonae voluntatis' 2"
"yourselves !  219  Moral judgment and condemnation is the favorite revenge of the spiritu- ally limited on those who are less so, as well as a type of compensation for having been slighted by nature, and an opportunity to finally acquire spirit and become refined: - malice spiritualizes"
"It warms the bottom of their hearts for there to be a standard that makes them the equal of even people who are teeming with all the qualities and privileges of spirit: - they fight for the 'equality of all before God' and almost need to believe in God for this reason alone"
"Among them are the strongest opponents of atheism"
"If anyone were to tell them that 'a high spirituality is beyond comparison with any sort of good behavior or worthiness of a merely moral man,' they would be livid: - 1 certainly would not do it"

"'  Ill   Beyond Good and Evil  order of rank in the world among things themselves - and not just among people"
"The fact then emerges that the overwhelming majority of things that interest and ap- peal to the more refined and discriminating tastes, to every higher nature, will strike the average person as utterly 'uninteresting"
"' If he notices a devotion to it anyway, then he calls it ' desinteresse ' and wonders how it is possible to act in a 'disinterested' fashion"
"' But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more discriminating spirit will not want to stay for very long: the truth is already desperate to keep herself from yawning when she is required to respond"
"In the end, she is a woman: we should not do violence to her"
"221  'It sometimes happens,' said a moralistic pedant and stickler for detail, 'that I honor and esteem an altruistic person"
"Not because he is altruistic, however, but because it seems to me that he has the right to help another person at his own expense"
"Enough, it is always a question of who he is and who that other is"
"For instance, in a person who was made and determined for command, self-denial and modest retreat would not be a virtue but  1 12   Our virtues  the waste of a virtue: that is how it seems to me"
"Every unegoistic morality that considers itself unconditional and is directed toward everyone does not just sin against taste: it is a provocation to sins of omission, and one more temptation under a mask of benevolence - a temptation and injury to precisely the higher, the rarer, the privileged"
"Morals must be compelled from the very start to bow before rank order , their presumptuousness must be forced onto their conscience, - until they are finally in agreement with each other that it is immoral to say: ‘What’s right for the one is fair for the other"
"’' - So says my moralistic pedant and bonhomme : 3 does he really deserve to be laughed at for urging morals to morality in this way? But you should not be too right if you want to get a laugh; a kernel of wrong belongs to even a good taste"
"222  Wherever pity is preached these days - and if you are listening properly, no other religion is preached any more - let the psychologist open up his ears"
"Through all the vanity, through all the noise that this preacher (like all preachers) intrinsically possesses, the psychologist will hear the genuine, rasping, groaning sound of self-hatred"
"Ele suffers: and his vanity would have it that he only pities"
"4  223  The hybrid mixed man of Europe - a fairly ugly plebeian, all in all - absolutely must have a costume: he needs history as a storage closet of costumes"
"Of course, he notices that nothing really looks right on him, - he keeps changing"
"Just look at these rapid preferences and changes in the masquerade of styles over the course of the nineteenth century; and at the moments of despair over the fact that 'nothing suits' us -"
"It is pointless to  3 Good man"
"4 In German: mit leidet (literally: 'suffers with')"
"Here as elsewhere, Nietzsche is playing on the similarities between the terms leiden (to suffer) and Mitleid (pity)"
"Thanks to this mixture, the past of every form and way of life, of cultures that used to lie side by side or on top of each other, radiates into us, we 'modern souls"
"' At this point, our instincts are running back everywhere and we ourselves are a type of chaos -"
"'Spirit,' as I have said, eventually finds that this is to its own advantage"
"Because of the half-barbarism in our bodies and desires, we have secret entrances everywhere, like no noble age has ever had, and, above all, access to the labyrinths of unfinished cul- tures and to every half-barbarism that has ever existed on earth"
"And since the most considerable part of human culture to date has been just such half-barbarism, the 'historical sense' practically amounts to a sense and  5 In customs and arts"
"6 With respect to"
"Our virtues  instinct for everything, a taste and tongue for everything: by which it im- mediately shows itself to be an ignoble sense"
"And no sense is more incomprehensible to such people than precisely this historical sense with its obsequious plebeian curiosity"
"We men of 'historical sense,' we do have our virtues - this cannot be denied"
"We are unassuming, selfless, modest, brave, full of self-overcoming, full of dedication, very grateful, very patient, very accommodating: - but for all that we are, perhaps, not very 'tasteful"

"Moderation is foreign to us, let us admit this to ourselves; our thrill is precisely the thrill of the infinite, the unmeasured"
"Like the rider on a steed snorting to go further onward, we let the reins drop before the infinite, we modern men, we half-barbarians - and we feel supremely happy only when we are in the most - danger"
"225  Hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, eudamonianism: these are all ways of thinking that measure the value of things according to pleasure and pain , which is to say according to incidental states and trivialities"
"They are all foreground ways of thinking and naivetes, and nobody who is conscious of both formative powers and an artist’s conscience will fail to regard them with scorn as well as pity"
"You want, if possible (and no 'if possi- ble' is crazier) to abolish suffering"
"It is quite important that as few people as possible think about morality - consequently, it is really quite important for morality not to somehow turn interesting one of these days! But there is no need to worry!  9 'We strive for the forbidden' from Ovid’s Amoves, III, 4, 17"
"No new thoughts, no sign of any subtle change or fold in an old thought, not even a real history of the earlier thought: an impossible literature on the whole, unless you know how to sour it with some malice"
"That old English vice called cant , 10 which is a piece of moral tartufferie, has insinuated itself into these moralists too (who have to be read with ulterior motives, if they have to be read at all -), hidden this time under a new form: science"
"And there is no lack of secret defenses against all the bites of conscience that will afflict a race of former Puritans whenever they deal with morality on a scientific level"
"They are a modest and thoroughly mediocre type of person, these utilitarian Englishmen, but, as I have said: to the extent  10 Nietzsche uses the English word"

"They should even be encouraged', as the following rhymes try, in part, to do"
"Perhaps I am taking a risk in allowing a truth like this to escape: let other people recapture it and make it drink the 'milk of pious reflection' until it lies quiet and forgotten in its old corner"
"- People should rethink their ideas about cruelty and open up their eyes; they should finally learn impatience, so that big, fat, presumptuous mistakes like this will stop wandering virtuously and audaciously about"
"An example of this is the mistaken ideas about tragedy that have been nurtured by both ancient and modern philosophers"
"This is my claim: almost everything we call 'higher culture' is based on the spiritualization and deepening of cruelty"
"The 'wild animal' has not been killed off at all; it is alive and well, it has just - become divine"
"Cruelty is what constitutes the painful sensu- ality of tragedy"
"And what pleases us in so-called tragic pity as well as in everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate of metaphysical tremblings, derives its sweetness exclusively from the intervening com- ponent of cruelty"
"'  120   Our virtues  her will and lets Tristan und Isolde 'wash over her' - what they all enjoy and crave with a mysterious thirst to pour down their throats is 'cruelty,' the spiced drink of the great Circe"
"We clearly need to drive out the silly psychology of the past; the only thing this psychology was able to teach about cruelty was that it originated from the sight of another's suffering"
"Even treating something in a profound or thorough manner is a violation, a wanting-to-hurt the fundamental will of the spirit, which constantly tends towards semblances and surfaces, - there is a drop of cruelty even in every wanting-to-know"
"230  Perhaps people will not immediately understand what I have said here about a 'fundamental will of the spirit': let me explain"
"— The com- manding element (whatever it is) that is generally called 'spirit' wants to dominate itself and its surroundings, and to feel its domination: it wills simplicity out of multiplicity, it is a binding, subduing, domineering, and truly masterful will"
"Its needs and abilities are the same ones that physi- ologists have established for everything that lives, grows, and propagates"
"Its  13 Sacrifice of the intellect"
"1 2 1   Beyond Good and Evil  intention here is to incorporate new 'experiences,' to classify new things into old classes, - which is to say: it aims at growth, or, more particularly, the feeling of growth, the feeling of increasing strength"
"Finally, the spirit’s not quite harmless willingness to deceive other spirits and to act a part in front of them belongs here too, that constant stress and strain of a creative, productive, mutable force"
"These are beautiful, twinkling, tinkling, festive words: genuine honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, the heroism of truthfulness, - there is something about them that makes you swell with pride"
"And we who have been prodded so much, we who have asked ourselves the same question a hundred times already, we have not found and are not Ending any better answers"
"231  Learning transforms us, it acts like all other forms of nourishment that do not just 'preserve' -: as physiologists know"
"But at our foundation, 'at the very bottom,' there is clearly something that will not learn, a brick wall of spiritual fatum , 15 of predetermined decisions and answers to selected, predetermined questions"
"In any cardinal problem, an immutable 'that is me' speaks up"
"When it comes to men and women, for instance, a thinker cannot change his views but only reinforce them, only finish discovering what, to his mind, 'is established"

"- On account of the abundant civility that I have just extended to myself, I will perhaps be more readily allowed to pronounce a few truths about the 'woman an sich': 16 assuming that people now know from the outset the extent to which these are only - my truths"
"—  232  Women want to become independent, so they are beginning to enlighten men about the 'woman an sick' - this is one of the worst developments in Europe’s general trend towards increasing ugliness"
"Isn’t it in the very worst taste when women prepare to be scientific like this? Fortunately, enlightenment had been a man’s business, a man’s talent until now - as such, we could remain 'among ourselves"
"' And with respect to everything that women write about 'woman,' we can ultimately reserve a healthy doubt as to whether women really want - and are able to want - to provide enlightenment about themselves"
"If this is not really all about some woman trying to find a new piece of finery for herself (and isn’t dressing up a part of the Eternal Feminine?), well then, she wants to inspire fear of  16 In German: das 'Weil? an sich"
"' The term 'an sich ' means 'in itself,' as in Kant’s Ding an sich (thing in itself)"
"I have left the term in German because any English rendering is clumsy, and the German retains both the gender neutrality and the philosophical connotations of the term"

"But she does not want truth: what does truth matter for a woman! Nothing is so utterly foreign, unfavorable, hostile for women from the very start than truth, — their great art is in ly- ing, their highest concern is appearance and beauty"
"Let us admit that we men love and honor precisely this art and this instinct in women: we have a rough time of it, and gladly seek relief by attaching ourselves to a being in whose hands, eyes, and gentle stupidities our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity look almost stupid to us"

"On the other hand, someone who has the same depth in his spirit as he does in his desires, and also that depth of goodwill which is capable of harshness and strictness and is easily mistaken for them - that sort of man will only ever be able to think about woman in an oriental manner"
"He needs to understand the woman as a possession, as property that can be locked up, as something predestined for servitude and fulfilled by it"
"Let us immediately add that she also loses her taste"
"She forgets her fear of man: but the woman who 'forgets fear' abandons her most feminine instincts"
"It is fair enough and also understandable enough for women to dare to emerge when fear of men is no longer inculcated, or, to be more exact, when the man in men is no longer wanted and cultivated; what is more difficult to understand is that in the process - women degenerate"
"This is happening today, make no mistake about it! Wherever the industrial spirit has won out over the military and aristocratic spirit, women are now striving for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: 'the woman as clerk' is written on the gateway to the developing, modern society"
"While women are seizing new rights in this manner, trying to become 'master' and writing 'progress' for women on their flags and pennants, the opposite is taking place with terrifying clarity: woman are regressing"
"Ever since the French Revolution, the influence of women in Europe has decreased proportionately as they have gained rights and entitlements"
"Accordingly, the 'emancipation of women,' to the extent that it has been demanded and called for by women themselves (and not just by shallow-minded masculine dolts), turns out to be a strange symptom of the increased weakening and softening of the most feminine instincts of all"
"The stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, is enough to make any woman who has turned out well (which always means a clever woman) thoroughly ashamed"
"What inspires pity, in spite of all the fear, for this dangerous and beautiful cat 'woman' is that she seems to suffer more, be more vulnerable, need more love, and be condemned to more disappointments than any animal"

"241  We 'good Europeans': even we have hours when we allow ourselves a robust fatherlandishness, a slip and backslide into old loves and confines (I have just given a sample of this), hours of national outbursts, patriotic trepidations, and all sorts of other antiquated floods of affect"
"But things that run their course in us in a matter of hours might take clumsier spirits longer periods of time to get over, a good half a year in some cases and half a lifetime in others, according to the speed and strength of their digestion and metabolism"
"In fact, I could imagine dull and hesitant races who would need half a century even in our speedy Europe to overcome such atavistic fits of fatherlandishness, to unglue themselves from the soil and return to reason, by which I mean 'good Europeanism"

"When ancient people read, if they read at all (it happened seldom enough), it was aloud to themselves, and moreover in a loud voice"
"People were surprised by someone reading quietly, and secretly wondered why"
"In a loud voice: that means with all the swells, inflections, sudden changes in tone, and shifts in tempo that the ancient, public world took pleasure in"
"At that time, the rules for written style were the same as those for spoken style, and those rules depended in part on the astonishing development and subtle requirements of the ear and larynx, and also, in part, on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lung"
"What the ancients meant by a period is primarily a physiological unit insofar as it is combined in a single breath"

"I am thinking about people like Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: and do not blame me for including Richard Wagner as well; we should not let his own self-misunderstanding lead us astray - geniuses of his type do not often have the right to understand themselves"
"Although, admittedly, it is not so apparent given the rude clamor with which Wagner is resisted and opposed in France today, it nonetheless remains the case that late French romanticism of the ’40s and Richard Wagner belong most closely and intimately together"

"Part 9 What is noble?  257  Every enhancement so far in the type 'man' has been the work of an aristocratic society - and that is how it will be, again and again, since this sort of society believes in a long ladder of rank order and value distinctions between men, and in some sense needs slavery"
"Of course, you cannot entertain any humanitarian illusions about how an aristocratic society originates (and any elevation of the type 'man' will presuppose an aristocratic society -): the truth is harsh"
"The noble caste always started out as the barbarian caste"
"Their supremacy was in psychic, not   Beyond Good and Evil  physical strength, - they were more complete people (which at any level amounts to saying 'more complete beasts' -)"
"258  Corruption, as an expression of the fact that anarchy threatens inside the instincts and that the foundation of the affects, which we call 'life,' has been shaken: corruption means fundamentally different things, depend- ing on the life-form in which it manifests itself"
"When, for instance, an aristocracy like that in France at the beginning of the Revolution throws away its privileges with a sublime disgust and sacrifices itself to an excess of its moral feeling, then this is corruption"
"It was really just the final act of that centuries-long corruption in which the aristocracy gradually relinquished its dominant authority and was reduced to a mere function of the kingdom (and, in the end, to its trinket and showpiece)"
"Its fundamental belief must always be that society cannot exist for the sake of society, but only as the substructure and framework for raising an exceptional type of being up to its higher duty and to a higher state of being"
"But as soon as this principle is taken any further, and maybe even  152   What is noble?  held to be the fundamental principle of society , it immediately shows it- self for what it is: the will to negate life, the principle of disintegration and decay"
"It will have to be the embodiment of will to power, it will want to grow, spread, grab, win dominance, - not out of any morality or immorality, but because it is alive , and because life is precisely will to power"
"'Exploitation' does not belong to a corrupted or imperfect, primitive society: it belongs to the essence of being alive as a fundamental organic function; it is a result of genuine will to power, which is just the will of life"
"- Although this is an innovation at the level of theory, — at the level of reality, it is the primal fact of all history"
"Let us be honest with ourselves to this extent at least! -  260  As I was wandering through the many subtle and crude moralities that have been dominant or that still dominate over the face of the earth, I found certain traits regularly recurring together and linked to each other"
"In the end, two basic types became apparent to me and a fundamental dis- tinction leapt out"
"There is a master morality and a slave morality ; — I will immediately add that in all higher and more mixed cultures, attempts to negotiate between these moralities also appear, although more frequently the two are confused and there are mutual misunderstandings"
"In fact, you sometimes find them sharply juxtaposed - inside the same person even,  i53   Beyond Good and Evil  within a single soul"
"In the first case, when domi- nating people determine the concept of 'good,' it is the elevated, proud states of soul that are perceived as distinctive and as determining rank order"
"The noble person separates himself off from creatures in which the opposite of such elevated, proud states is expressed: he despises them"
"It is immediately apparent that, in this first type of morality, the contrast between 'good' and 'bad' amounts to one between 'noble' and 'despi- cable' (the contrast between 'good' and 'evil' has a different lineage)"
"People who were cowardly, apprehensive, and petty, people who thought narrowly in terms of utility - these were the ones despised"
"But the same can be said about distrustful people with their uneasy glances, about grov- elers, about dog-like types of people who let themselves be mistreated, about begging flatterers and, above all, about liars: - it is a basic belief of aristocrats that base peoples are liars"
"'We who are truthful' - that is what the nobility of ancient Greece called themselves"
"It is obvious that moral expressions everywhere were first applied to people and then, only later and derivatively, to actions (which is why it is a tremendous mistake when historians of morality take their point of departure from questions such as 'why do acts of pity get praised?')"
"The noble type of person feels that he determines value, he does not need anyone’s approval, he judges that 'what is harmful to me is harmful in itself,' he knows that he is the one who gives honor to things in the first place, he creates values"
"He honors everything he sees in himself: this sort of morality is self-glorifying"
"In the foreground, there is the feeling of fullness, of power that wants to overflow, the happiness associated with a high state of tension, the con- sciousness of a wealth that wants to make gifts and give away"
"The noble person helps the unfortunate too, although not (or hardly ever) out of pity, but rather more out of an impulse generated by the over-abundance of power"
"In honoring himself, the noble man honors the powerful as well as those who have power over themselves, who know how to speak and be silent, who joyfully exercise severity and harshness over themselves, and have respect for all forms of severity and harshness"
"'Wotan has put a hard heart in my breast,' reads a line from an old Scandinavian saga: this rightly comes from the soul of a proud Viking"
"This sort of a man  i54   What is noble?  is even proud of not being made for pity: which is why the hero of the saga adds, by way of warning, 'If your heart is not hard when you are young, it will never be hard"
"' The noble and brave types of people who think this way are the furthest removed from a morality that sees precisely pity, actions for others, and desinteressement 1 as emblematic of morality"
"A faith in yourself, pride in yourself, and a fundamental hostility and irony with respect to 'selflessness' belong to a noble morality just as certainly as does a slight disdain and caution towards sympathetic feelings and 'warm hearts"
"' - The powerful are the ones who know how to honor; it is their art, their realm of invention"
"A profound reverence for age and origins - the whole notion of justice is based on this double reverence a faith and a prejudice in favor of forefathers and against future generations is typical of the morality of the powerful"
"And when, conversely, people with 'modern ideas' believe almost instinctively in 'progress' and 'the future,' and show a decreasing respect for age, this gives sufficient evi- dence of the ignoble origin of these 'ideas"
"- It is different with the second type of morality, slave morality"
"The slave’s gaze resents the virtues of the powerful"
"It is skeptical and distrustful, it has a subtle mistrust of all the 'good' that is honored there it wants to convince  1 Disinterestedness"
"155   Beyond Good and Evil  itself that even happiness is not genuine there"
"Slave morality is essentially a moral- ity of utility"
"Here we have the point of origin for that famous opposition between 'good' and 'evil"
"' Evil is perceived as something powerful and dangerous; it is felt to contain a certain awesome quality, a subtlety and strength that block any incipient contempt"
"According to the slave moral- ity then, 'evil' inspires fear; but according to the master morality, it is ' good ' that inspires and wants to inspire fear, while the 'bad' man is seen as contemptible"
"2 Wher- ever slave morality holds sway, language shows a tendency for the words 'good' and 'stupid' to come closer together"
"- This clearly shows why love as passion (our European specialty) must have had a purely noble descent: it is known to have been invented in the knightly poetry of Provence, by those magnificent, inventive men of the 'gai saber"
"' 3 Europe is indebted to these men for so many things, almost for itself"
"261  Vanity is perhaps one of the most difficult things for a noble person to comprehend: he wifi be tempted to keep denying it when a different type of man wifi almost be able to feel it in his hands"
"He has difficulty imag- ining creatures who would try to inspire good opinions about themselves that they themselves do not hold - and consequently do not 'deserve'  2 A good simple fellow"
"3 Gay science"
"What is noble?  either and who would then end up believing these good opinions"
"For one thing, this strikes the noble as being so tasteless and showing such a lack of self-respect, and, for another thing, it seems so baroque and unreasonable to him, that he would gladly see vanity as an exception and stay skeptical in most of the cases where it is brought up"
"For example, he will say: 'I can be wrong about my own worth and still insist that other people acknowledge it to be what I say it is, - but that is not vanity (instead, it is arrogance or, more frequently, it is what they call ‘humility’ or ‘modesty’)"
"We can see it as the result of a tremendous atavism that, to this day, ordinary people still wait for an opinion to be pronounced about themselves before instinctively deferring to it"
"But in every age it is opposed by an older, broader, and more thoroughly ingrained tendency, - and in the phenomenon of 'vanity,' this older tendency gains mastery over the younger"
"The vain take pleasure in every good opinion they hear about themselves (abstracted entirely from the point of view of utility, and just as much removed from truth or falsity), just as they suffer from every bad opinion"
"This is because they submit - they feel submissive - to both good and bad opinions out of that oldest instinct of submissiveness  i57   Beyond Good and Evil  which erupts within them"
"- This is 'the slave' in the blood of the vain, a remnant of the mischief of the slave - and how much 'slave' is still left over in women, for instance! -, they try to seduce people into having good opinions of them"
"By the same token, it is the slave who submits to these opinions immediately afterwards, as if he were not the one who had just called for them"
"- And to say it again: vanity is an atavism"
"262  A species 4 5 originates, a type grows sturdy and strong, in the long struggle with essentially constant unfavorable conditions"
"Here there are none of the advantages, excesses, and protections that are favorable to variation"
"The species needs itself to be a species, to be something that, by virtue of its very hardness, uniformity, and simplicity of form, can succeed and make itself persevere in constant struggle with its neigh- bors or with the oppressed who are or threaten to become rebellious"
"A tremendous range of experiences teaches it which qualities are primarily responsible for the fact that, despite all gods and men, it still exists, it keeps prevailing"
"It calls these qualities virtues, and these are the only virtues it fosters"
"It does so with harshness; in fact, it desires harshness"
"Every aristocratic morality is intolerant about the education of the young, disposal over women, marriage customs, relations between old and young and penal laws (which only concern deviants): - it considers intolerance itself to be a virtue, under the rubric of 'justice"
"' A type whose traits are few in number but very strong, a species of people who are strict, warlike, clever, and silent, close to each other and closed up (which gives  4 In German: Art"

"The continuous struggle with constant unfavorable con- ditions is, as I have said, what causes a type to become sturdy and hard"
"But, eventually, a fortunate state will arise and the enormous tension will relax; perhaps none of the neighbors are enemies anymore, and the means of life, even of enjoying life, exist in abundance"
"With a single stroke, the bonds and constraints of the old discipline are torn: it does not seem to be necessary any more, to be a condition of existence, - if it wanted to continue, it could do so only as a form of luxury, as an archaic taste"
"Variation, whether as deviation (into something higher, finer, rarer) or as degeneration and monstrosity, suddenly comes onto the scene in the greatest abundance and splendor; the individual dares to be individual and different"
"At these turning points of history, a magnificent, diverse, jungle-like growth and upward striving, a kind of tropical tempo in the competition to grow will appear alongside (and often mixed up and tan- gled together with) an immense destruction and self-destruction"
"This is due to the wild egoisms that are turned explosively against each other, that wrestle each other 'for sun and light,' and can no longer derive any limitation, restraint, or refuge from morality as it has existed so far"
"It was this very morality that accumulated the tremendous amount of force to put such a threatening tension into the bow: - and now it is, now it is being 'outlived"
"' The dangerous and uncanny point has been reached when the greatest, most diverse, most comprehensive life lives past the old morality"
"The 'individual' is left standing there, forced to give him- self laws, forced to rely on his own arts and wiles of self-preservation, self-enhancement, self-redemption"
"Only the mediocre have prospects for continuing on, for propagating - they are the people of the future, the only survivors: 'Be like them! Be mediocre!' is the only morality that still makes sense, that still finds ears"
"Anyone whose task and exercise is the investigation of souls will use this very art, in a variety of forms, to establish the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, inborn order of rank it belongs to: this sort of investigator will test out the soul’s instinct for respect"
"Difference engendre haine : 6 many natures have a baseness that suddenly bursts out, like dirty water, when any sort of holy vessel, any sort of treasure from a closed shrine, any sort of book that bears the mark of a great destiny is carried past"
"On the other hand, there is an involuntary hush, a hesitation of the eye and a quieting of every gesture, all of which indicate that the soul feels the presence of something deserving the highest honors"
"The way in which respect for the Bible has, on the whole, been maintained in Europe might be the best piece of discipline and refinement in manners that Europe owes to Christianity"
"Books with this sort of profundity and ultimate meaning need the protection of an externally imposed tyranny of authority; this way, they can last through the millennia that are needed to use them up and figure them out"
"It is a great achievement when the  6 'Difference engenders hatred"
"Conversely, what is perhaps the most disgusting thing about so-called scholars, the devout believers in 'mod- ern ideas,' is their lack of shame, the careless impudence of their eyes and hands that touch, taste, and feel everything"
"And there might still be a greater relative nobility of taste and tactfulness of respect within a people these days, within a lower sort of people, namely within the peasantry, than among the newspaper-reading demimonde of the spirit, the educated"
"It is utterly impossible that a person might fail to have the qualities and propensities of his elders and ancestors in his body: however much appearances might speak against it"
"This is the problem of race"
"If you know anything about the ancestors, you can draw conclusions about the child"
"Some sort of harmful immoderation, some sort of corner jealousy, a clumsy insistence on always being right - together, these three elements have constituted the true 'vulgar' type in every age"
"And something like this will be passed on to the child just as certainly as contaminated blood"
"With the help of the best education and culture, people will only just reach the point of being able to lie about a bequest like this"
"And what else are education and culture for these days! In our very popular, which is to say vulgar age, 'education' and 'culture' essentially have to be the art of deception - to deceive about lineage, about the inherited vulgarity in body and soul"
"I mean that firm belief that other beings will, by nature, have to be subordinate to a being 'like us' and will have to sacrifice themselves"
"The noble soul accepts this fact of its egoism without any question-mark, and also without feeling any harshness, compulsion, or caprice in it, but rather as something that may well be grounded in the primordial law of things"
"If the noble soul were to try to name this phenomenon, it would call it 'justice itself"
"' It admits to itself, under certain circumstances (that at first give it pause), that there are others with rights equal to its own"
"As soon as it is clear about this question of rank, it will move among these equals and 'equally righted' with an assured modesty and a gentle reverence equal to how it treats itself, in accordance with an inborn, celestial mechanics that all stars know so well"
"This is just another piece of its egoism, this finesse and self-limitation in dealing with equals - every star is an egoist of this sort"
"And the noble soul honors itself in them and in the rights that it gives them; it has no doubt that the exchange of rights and honors belongs to the natural state of things too, as the essence of all interaction"
"The noble soul gives as it takes, out of the passionate and sensitive instinct of retribution that is so fundamental to it"
"The concept of 'mercy' is senseless and noisome inter pares ; 7 8 there might be a sublime way of letting gifts fall down on you from above, as it were, and lapping them up like raindrops; but the noble soul has no talent for this art and conduct"

"' And to choose for company that mischievous and cheerful vice, politeness"
"And to keep control over your four virtues: courage, insight, sympathy, solitude"
"Because solitude is a virtue for us, since it is a sublime inclina- tion and impulse to cleanliness which shows that contact between people ('society') inevitably makes things unclean"
"Somewhere, sometime, every community makes people - 'base"
"'  285  The greatest events and thoughts - but the greatest thoughts are the greatest events - are the last to be comprehended: generations that are their contemporaries do not experience these sorts of events, - they live right past them"
"The same thing happens here as happens in the realm of stars"
"The light from the furthest stars is the last to come to people; and until it has arrived, people will deny that there are - stars out there"
"'How many centuries does it take for a spirit to be comprehended?' — this standard is also used to create the rank order and etiquette needed - by both spirit and star"
"-  286  'The vision is free here and the spirit elevated"
"' 14 - But there is an inverse type of person who is also at a height and also has a free vision - but who looks down"
"Among artists and scholars these days, you will find plenty of people whose works reveal them to be driven by a deep desire for nobility"
"But this very need for nobility is fundamentally different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and almost serves as an eloquent and dangerous testimony to the absence of such needs"
"One of the most subtle ways of deceiving people (at least for as long as this is possible), and successfully pretending to be more stupid than you really are (a skill that is as handy as an umbrella, in day-to-day life), is enthusiasm-, including what belongs to it - virtue, for instance"
"Because, as Galiani said, and he must have known vertu est enthousiasme"
"15  289  In a hermit’s writings, you can always hear something of the echo of the desert, something of the whisper and the timid sideways glance of solitude"
"A new and more dangerous type of silence, of concealment, rings out in his strongest words, even in his cries"
"Anyone who has sat alone with  15 'Virtue is enthusiasm' from Galiani’s Letter to Madame d’Epinay , II, p"
"' 16 Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy - that is a hermit’s judgment: 'There is something arbitrary in his stopping here, looking back, looking around, in his not digging any deeper here , and putting his spade away - there is also something suspicious about it"
"' Every philosophy conceals a philosophy too: every opinion is also a hiding place, every word is also a mask"
"290  Every profound thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood"
"Perhaps this point of view involves a much broader conception of 'art' than people are used to"
"16 In German: ein Abgrund hinter jedem Grtinde , unterjeder ' Begriindung"
"A philosopher: oh, a being who is frequently running away from himself, frequently afraid of himself, - but too curious not to always come back to himself"
"The unmanliness of what is christened 'pity' in the circles of these enthusiasts is always, I think, the first thing that strikes your eye"
"- This latest type of bad taste needs to be forcefully and thoroughly exorcized; and ultimately, I would like people to put the good amulet of 'gai saber ' around their hearts and necks to fight it off, - 'gay science,' to make it germane to Germans"
"18  294  The Olympian vice"
"- In spite of that philosopher who, being a true Englishman, tried to give laughter a bad reputation among all thoughtful  17 Nietzsche is again playing on the similarity between Mitleiden (pity) and leiden (to suffer)"
"18 In German: um es den Deutschen zu verdeutlichen (literally: to clarify it to Germans)"
"And given that even gods philosophize (a conclusion I have been drawn to many times -), I do not doubt that they know a new and super-human way of laughing - at the expense of everything serious! Gods like to make fun of things: it seems as if they cannot stop laughing, even during holy rites"
"but what am I doing, my friends? Who am I talking about? Have I forgotten myself so much that I haven’t even told you his name? Unless you have already guessed on your  19 In German: Versucher-Gott"
"This could also mean the 'experimenting god"
"I seem to be the last one to have offered him a sacrifice : because I have not found anyone who understood what I was doing then"
"And perhaps in recounting my story, I will have to take frankness further than will always be agreeable to the strict habits of your ears? Certainly, the god in question went further in dialogues like this, much, much further, and was always many steps ahead of me"
"In fact, if it were permissible to follow human custom in ascribing beautiful, solemn names of splendor and virtue to him, I would have to offer many praises for his explorer’s, discoverer’s heart, for his daring and genuine honesty, his truthfulness and his love of wisdom"
"But a god like this will have no use at all for this honorable rubbish and splendor"
"I am very fond of  20 A reference to Nietzsche’s first published book, Die Geburt der Tragodie ( The Birth of Tragedy) (1872)"
"176   What is noble?  them: I think about how I can help them advance and make them stronger, more evil and more profound than they are"
"' - 'Stronger, more evil, and more profound?' I asked, startled"
"- 'Yes,' he said again, 'stronger, more evil, and more profound; and more beautiful' - and at that, the tempter god smiled his halcyon smile, as if he had just paid a charming compliment"
"You can see: this divinity lacks more than just shame but you can also see that there are good reasons for supposing that the gods could learn a thing or two from us humans"
"We humans are - more human 21"
"This could also mean 'more humane"
"My table waits for you with each delight: - Such lonely ledges  Are home to few, save stars and chasms’ edges"
"My realm - its bounds reach past the range of sight,  My honey too - who dreams they’ll taste the like?"
"The work of a magician I’d befriended,  The friend of noon-time - but — no! don’t ask who - It was at noon, when one turned into two"
"Now we can feast, with triumph in the air,  The fest of all fests:  Friend Zarathustra came, the guest of all guests!  The world can laugh, the gruesome curtain tear,  The wedding day of light and dark was here"
