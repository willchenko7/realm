Repository for Evolutionary Algorithms with Language Models (REALM)

Language models have taken the world by storm by demonstrating a wide range of intelligence. However, for them to be considered AGI and solve problems that no human has solved before, it seems like something is still missing. 

Most language models are trained to predict the next token through back propagation. Meaning that is given the start of a sentence, and it needs to predict what the next word in the sentence will be. In this setup, it has a clear output label, the next token. Therefore, it is trained to "think" like its training data. Naturally, this can be used to train an AI that will talk like someone specific, like Frederich Nietzche, or a group of people, like a subreddit channel. However, this makes it very difficult for the AI's to be unique, as they are more like a condensed representation of their training data. This is extremely powerful, but how can we get the AI's to become more unique and individualistic?

In contrast to back propogation, the human mind was built through evolution. Through evolution, more diversity and individualism can be acheived as there is no prediefined label for success. The only metric for training is survival and reproduction. I believe that this may hold a key to getting artificial intelligence to be individualistic too.

In this repo, we will explore different ways of building language models that are trained through evolutionary algorithms.
